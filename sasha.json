But Chrome is minimized, and you&amp;#39;re trying to launch a game.  And that game is requesting more memory than is actually available.  The kernel will ask Chrome to begin unloading tabs from memory one by one, possibly by loading some to the paging file, without you knowing at all, other than clicking on those tabs having a brief pause when you come back to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why Android has been begging people to stop using those &amp;quot;Task killer&amp;quot; apps for years now.  In 90% of situations, all they do is make your system work harder to load apps from internal eMMC instead of RAM, which wastes battery.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, there&amp;#39;s always the 10% of situations where a program is poorly coded and flags itself as &amp;quot;ultra high important foreground all the time never unload me&amp;quot; even though it isn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "created": 1475329525.0, "id": "d89aqid", "mod_reports": [], "archived": false, "likes": null, "score": 293, "distinguished": null, "score_hidden": false, "gilded": 0, "controversiality": 0, "ups": 293, "report_reasons": null, "edited": false, "approved_by": null, "saved": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo"}, {"body": "&gt; Chrome taking up 1GB of RAM\n\nhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha", "num_reports": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "subreddit": "Showerthoughts", "removal_reason": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1475304667.0, "name": "t1_d89c4a1", "parent_id": "t1_d89aqid", "banned_by": null, "author": "Semyonov", "link_id": "t3_55ascw", "user_reports": [], "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chrome taking up 1GB of RAM&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "created": 1475333467.0, "id": "d89c4a1", "mod_reports": [], "archived": false, "likes": null, "score": 159, "distinguished": null, "score_hidden": false, "gilded": 0, "controversiality": 0, "ups": 159, "report_reasons": null, "edited": false, "approved_by": null, "saved": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2szyo"}, {"body": "I have a tab with a paused Netflix movie, a tab browsing Netflix movies, a tab for Google play music, 13 reddit tabs, 11 4chan threads, and a few Google search tabs.

There tends to be a natural upper limit for how fast a piston can be moving, and at the same rpm an engine with a longer stroke will have its pistons moving at a greater average speed to complete each cycle. The interesting thing is that the maximum MPS (mean piston speed) of the highest revving NA engines of various sizes all tend to be close to 25 meters per second. That's why high revving engines go with a larger bore:stroke ratio, so they can maintain a desirable cylinder displacement while still having a stratospheric redline. Of course, a short stroke engine with a mean piston speed of 25 m/s at 15,000 rpm would have to accelerate and change directions over a much shorter distance and time than a long stroke one at 7000 rpm, so the G's would be much higher.

The interesting thing is that the maximum MPS (mean piston speed) of the highest revving NA engines of various sizes all tend to be close to 25 meters per second. That&amp;#39;s why high revving engines go with a larger bore:stroke ratio, so they can maintain a desirable cylinder displacement while still having a stratospheric redline. Of course, a short stroke engine with a mean piston speed of 25 m/s at 15,000 rpm would have to accelerate and change directions over a much shorter distance and time than a long stroke one at 7000 rpm, so the G&amp;#39;s would be much higher.
