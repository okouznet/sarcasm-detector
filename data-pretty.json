        "body": "Cross Post from /r/AskHistorians   **ELI5 - Holocaust Denial**\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3m5wjn/eli5_holocaust_denial/cvco45h\n\n\nSo, first, I need to clarify exactly what it is you're asking. My understanding of your question - and hence what I'll answer is 'What exactly is Holocaust denial, and what aspects of the Holocaust do deniers reject?\" Additionally, I'll discuss how Holocaust deniers deny the Holocaust. I'll also touch on the motivations of deniers, which is inextricably linked with their methodology.\n\n----\n\n**What exactly is Holocaust denial?**\n\nHolocaust denial's best, simple definition is \"the activity of denying the occurrence of key events and processes which constitute the Holocaust.\"1 Since deniers have no unified set of beliefs, exactly which aspect/s of the Holocaust they deny can vary greatly. Almost invariably, their claims boil down to a conclusion stating that the established number of individuals killed by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust - either six or eleven million, depending on whether non-Jewish victims of German mass-murders are included in the total - is false, and that the 'true' number of victims is considerably lower than the above totals.\n\nA Holocaust denier might claim, for instance, that a total of one million Jews were killed (though they will usually also claim they merely 'died' rather than being deliberately murdered), as opposed to the established total of ~six million. Holocaust deniers will often also deny the methodology of the Holocaust. They will often claim that Nazi Germany's 'Final Solution' aimed only to deport Jews from the Reich (as opposed to their mass murder), and may deny any or all of the following: state-organised mass murder of Jews and other minorities; the death camp system; gas chambers in the death camps; and the existence or actions of the SS Einsatzgruppen. The exact nature of what is being denied often varies, but the theme remains clear: Holocaust deniers deny one or more aspects of the Holocaust, and purport that the number of Jews and other minorities murdered in the Holocaust is subsequently lower than the historically established figures.\n\n-----------\n\n**What is the methodology of Holocaust Deniers?**\n\nHolocaust deniers deny the Holocaust in the face of a truly extraordinary mountain of evidence. The factual accuracy of the Holocaust is completely irrefutable, and no rational, informed individual would ever dispute its existence or its methodology. Few, if any, events in history are as well recorded, studied, examined and re-examined as the Holocaust. While there remains, of course, a huge amount to be learned about the minutiae of the Holocaust, its scale and functionality are so thoroughly documented by untold millions of photographs, eyewitness accounts, contemporary documents, film reels and items of physical evidence (for instance, collections of the wedding rings and shoes of those 'processed' through the death camp system or the gas chambers themselves) that rational, evidence-based disputes of its general methodology and progression are non-existent.\n\nHolocaust deniers hence find themselves attempting to deny established fact. They have no significant evidence to support their denial, and hence resort to a variety of methods ranging from fabricated evidence and psuedo-academic argumentation to emotional claims of far-reaching conspiracy - inevitably masterminded by Jews. They will often attempt to dismiss the vast array of evidence demonstrating the existence of the Holocaust as forgeries and lies planted by the above-mentioned conspirators to fool the public, in order to avoid engaging with said evidence. They would likely claim, for instance, that I am a paid shill. Since they aim to propagate lies in the face of insurmountable evidence, they must rely on fallacious verbal arguments, ideological dogma and the exploitation of ignorance to spread their beliefs.\n\nAn excellent example of the above is the writing of Germar Rudolph, a German chemist and Holocaust denier. Rudolph authored a paper in 1991 titled \"Report on the formation and verifiability of cyanide compounds in the Auschwitz gas chambers,\" wherein he asserted various claims against the plausibility of the gas chamber system at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. To the untrained eye, Rudolph's report appears academic, however upon examination it is false in its entirety, based on fabricated and misrepresented data, and using intentionally misleading and dishonest methodology to present falsehood as truth.5 For a detailed dissection of Rudolph's writing, please see the above footnote, which makes for fascinating - if chilling - reading.\n\n------------------\n\n\n**On the motivation of Holocaust Deniers**\n\n\nHolocaust deniers are invariably motivated by ideological beliefs. In comparison to a historian, who forms theories based on evidence, Holocaust deniers cherry pick or fabricate evidence to support their ideological beliefs. These beliefs are, invariably, based on \"hatred of Jews or a desire to rehabilitate the discredited philosophy of National Socialism.\"6 In other words, Holocaust deniers invariably deny the Holocaust due to their deep-seated ideological beliefs, rather than any kind of evidence-based reasoning. /u/CrossyNZ, in a post three years ago on this topic, laid out (with some of the most brilliant prose I've ever seen) the motivation of deniers better than I could ever hope to:\n\n&gt;*\"The Holocaust is a site of rich meaning and understanding, understandings which have be made into a narrative about what is true virtue, and what happens in the lack of it. Although awful, other genocides did not get this build up of meaning around them, and so are pushed into the public's historical background. As historians we know how some events carry more \"charge\" and meaning around them. ((For Americans, examples would be things like Pearl Harbor, the dropping of the atomic bombs, and 9/11. Events which polarize people because they see that event as a day when the world for them \"altered\".))*\n\n&gt;*\"In some ways, therefore, and forgive me, Holocaust deniers aren't attacking the historical truth of the holocaust - that would be an absurd thing to do. If it was just the historical truth of the Holocaust free from this meaning, then they wouldn't give two figs. They are seeking to reject parts of that richness of understanding built up around it that they find themselves objecting to - and they chose this ridiculous, offensive method to do it. As an historian and a human being, I cannot have more contempt for them.*\n\n&gt;*\"Trying to convince them of the obvious, blatant truth of the Holocaust is therefore a lost cause, because they are not interested in the truth. They are interested in making go away whatever crawling feeling they get when the meanings attached to the holocaust - the dangers of racism, classifications, and intolerance - call out their own value set as dangerous and potentially destructive. A \"direct attack\" on their methods - pointing out the thousands of witnesses, showing the immense amount of physical evidence (both the grounds of the camps themselves and the vast amount of paperwork created by this event) - is a waste of time, because it doesn't address the real issue; that the person so denying doesn't want it to be true. Why don't they? Maybe they are convinced by racism, just a little, in their heart of hearts. Maybe they hate Israel and equate all Jews with it. The thing is, you can't know these other reasons. If you don't know what their problem is, you can't change their mind by arguing. Therefore, I suppose, the only thing to do with Holocaust deniers is to feel contempt for their methods, ignore their attempts to engage you in a public conversation, and pity them that they could have such a conflict inside them it causes them to forsake reality.\"*\n\nHolocaust denial is the victory of hatred and dogma over empathy, reason and truth in the minds of its proponents. It is a tragic phenomenon that we encounter all too often. I hope the above explanation will help you to understand it. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to respond.\n\n\n**Sources**\n\n\n&gt;Catriona Mckinnon, \"Should we tolerate Holocaust Denial?\" Res Publica 13.1 (2007), 9.

I still thought it was good but the drastic drop in animation quality and the extremely dense MC made me enjoy it a lot less than I thought I would. \n\n**Most Surprising Anime:** Alderamin, Re:Zero, Saiki and 91 Days.\n\n**Most Dissapointing Anime:** Danganronpa 3: Mirai-Hen. I just expected more crazy plot twists and a more interesting conclusion than the one we got.\n\n**Best Girl(s):** Rem. I know a lot of people hate her now but I really really liked her character. Some other really great ones were Chiaki and Kirigiri (both from Danganronpa 3), Futaba Ooki (Amanchu), Usami (Kono Bijutsubu) and Alisha (Tales of Zestiria)\n\n**Best Guy(s):** Suwa from Orange by far foe being the best biggest bro ever. Also really liked the clever Ikta in Alderamin and Saiki for just not giving a single fuck.\n\n**Worst Girl:** Junko Enoshima wins by default since Danganronpa 3 aired this season. It's rare that I hate a character as much as her.\n\n**Worst Guy:** Nagito Komaeda. Same deal as with Junko. Pure trash.\n\nNote: I consider neither Nagito nor Junko to be badly written characters so if that's how worst guy/girl is supposed to be interpreted I don't mean that.\n\n**Best OP(s):** Both Mob Psycho 100's and Tales of Zestiria's OP are amazing in terms of music and art in my opinion. Another great one is Amanchu's OP because of how calm and comfy it is.\n\n**Best ED(s):** I liked a lot of EDs this season. My favourites were Re:Zero's first ED and Danganronpa 3 Zetsubou-Hen's ED (Can't beat Nagito's voice actor singing). \n\n**Best meme:** Literally every episode of Love Live: Sunshine. Loved how imaginative people were with those photoshops.\n\n**Worst meme (Don't ban me please):** [Re:Zero Major Spoiler](/s \"Who is Rem?\") Was literally only funny for like 30 minutes before this sub completely ran it into the ground.\n\nI typed all of this on my phone so if there are any spelling mistakes I apologize.\n",

Think about how few of them would need to coordinate to have near complete dominance of what gets upvoted/downvoted in conversations and even threads.\n\nThese CTR trolls have heavily resided in /r/politics in pretty successful attempts at manipulating reddit. I've seen it, accounts with 20+ pro-hillary posts a day, for weeks on end, there is a subreddit dedicated to pointing them out.

And the Franco-Canadians that do exist here have co-existed for so long that they're basically indistinguishable from the rest of the Anglo-Canadian population. The way \"English and French are Canada's official languages, use it, non-assimilating non-white people!\" meme on this sub annoys me to no end because there is no actual support for French content or topics on this sub. It's really almost always utilized exclusively by Anglo-white supremacists under the guise of some mild mannered Canadian nationalism. The one time I recall someone posting on this sub asking if there were any Francophones around it was downvoted to hell and the comments were \"je veu du fromage\" type stuff. Please, stop using French as some weird tool to push your agenda against \"foreign\" languages when aside from that, you never cared about French issues to begin with. The reason why French signage exists in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick isn't because of some abstract Canadian nationalist sentiment, it's because there is a population that would do better because of it. The equivalents here in BC are Chinese and Punjabi because those are the most used languages after English. They are living breathing languages being used on a daily basis. If it weren't for the perceived threat of new cultures and peoples co-existing in the same space as previously Anglo-dominated regions, nobody in BC would even give two hoots about French, and that was just the way it was before all this Richmond Chinese Sign Ghetto nonsense was spread around on the internet. \n\nRedditors on r/Vancouver are also dancing around the bear in the room - that even from a historical standpoint the Chinese and Pacific Asian countries have had a far greater influence here in both a human, political, and economic capacity that was only curtailed by artificial limitations placed on them like the Chinese Head Tax or outright exclusion. The only reason French is even taught in K-12 here is because the government forces it. From a practical perspective, teaching any of the Asian languages would both be much more useful given Asia's proximity to the west coast and easier to learn given that their are large populations of native speakers for most of the major languages. Think about it... Vancouver is in a unique situation that almost no other city is in to take advantage of a a region where there are tonnes of 0th generation Chinese, Indians, and Koreans who all speak their native languages. \n\nThese are major world languages with potentially millions of future customers and emerging markets. So why the fuck not take advantage of it? Why shouldn't ever goddamn person in this goddamn region be trilingual? Vancouver has the criteria to become a truly global mega-city in the future which dwarfs Seattle, but people are too fucked in the head to realize it because they're too proud to give up their version of \"Canadian\" culture. We could have been the Singapore of the West Coast, or even better, but nope, fuck learning an actual second or third language. Fuck immigrants, am I right? How about, instead of trying to eliminate foreign influences to save a non-existent quasi Anglo-French identity, maybe British Columbians should realize it never existed here in the first place. Let's be honest, people in BC can't understand any French to save our lives. I went through French education for 12 years and I can't even remember a thing of what I was taught, because there is truly nobody to talk in French with. But there is a LARGE Chinese population just south of Vancouver you know, so why not like, take advantage of it? Why does every single fucking thing have to be a negative? How about the next time you see a Chinese language sign, be like, oh shit I know what that means, maybe I should translate it, go into the store, and ask if maybe the owner would like you to know what it means in English? Maybe the next time you see a Chinese only menu, you could offer to translate it and show them that there are actually non-Chinese people who'll use their services, so they'll be incentivized to include English as well? Or you could just bitch about it on the internet  in mommy's basement or somewhere and talk about how immigrants aren't assimilating.\n\n",

        "body": "Hello Reddit! I am Lainey Love and I am an open minded 21-year-old curvy MILF with over 300 days of online selling experience. I love to do crazy and odd fetish requests and challenge you to bring me something I haven't done or seen before! I'm 420% chill although that doesn't seem to be a popular request. I have a bit of cam anxiety so I prefer kik sessions but I'm available for both! The majority of my prices are not a la carte because I prefer a more personalized touch to handling my business. You will find an extensive detailed list of both my interests and experience as well as the services that I offer listed below this bio. At the very least I'm interested in trying almost all fetish related play but I'm especially fond of D/s dynamics (CEI is my *favorite*), Sissification, Foot fetish, and any roleplay. **I offer multi-seller kik sessions, kik me (laineylactate) me for availability.** As for the D/s dynamics, I am a fairly firm Domme however given the right buyer or DD/lg I will play switch.\n\n**Here's my list of interests and fetishes:**\n \n* Squirting\n* Multi-seller kik sessions\n* Foot worship/hypnosis/fetish\n* B/G Play\n* Domination\n* Humiliation\n* Sissification\n* Forced Intoxication\n* Tasks\n* JOI/JOE\n* Strip tease\n* Roleplay\n* Edging\n* Dress up\n* Chastity/Keyholding\n* Squidplay\n* Cuckholding\n* Any mailed items (socks/panties/bras/ect)\n* Lactation (I'm not longer lactating, premade content)\n* MUCH MUCH more... \n\n**I'm available for:** \n\n* Kik Sessions\n* Custom and Premade Videos\n* Live cam/skype\n* GFE\n* Custom Photo Sets\n* Custom shipped items\n* Dick/Cumshot Ratings (text and video)\n\n**Of course I show face you silly boys!**\n\nI take almost every form of payment but bitcoin or google wallet work best for me! The best place to reach me is via **kik**, my username is **LaineyLactate**. I'm on EST and the best times to reach be are between 1pm-5am, but you can kik me any time of the day, I just may be slow to respond if I'm busy or asleep.\n\n**Disclaimer:** If you decide on a kik session, cam show, or GFE please make your expectations and requests clear before making payment so that I'm ready to accommodate them. While I'm open to suggestions and requests during the kik session, I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, or being rude. A second infraction will terminate our agreement without refund.\n\n[Do you have experience developing subreddits?](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaineyLove/comments/54n1x4/looking_for_help_developingmanaging_this_subreddit/)\n",

Lets say your space capsule has a mass of 1 ton, has an engine and fuel tank that weigh another ton, and is conveniently in orbit already. \n\nSo, how much fuel can that tank hold?  Your rocket engine only works while it has fuel, right (just like your car needs gas in its tank, or your cell phone needs charge in it's battery)\n\nThere was a really smart Russian by the name of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky that figured this out in the late 1800's\n\nHe figured out this.\n\nThe change in velocity (delta-v) is equal to\n\nYour rocket's exhaust velocity x the natural log of its fully fueled mass divided by it's empty mass\n\ndelta v = velocity of exhaust * ln (mass full/mass empty)\n\nSo say your 1 ton of fuel tank and engine can hold 10 tons of fuel\n\nand lets say you are burning liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen (nearly the best bang for the buck with chemical rocket engines that don't use scary things like fluorine)\n\nLooking on the internet the characteristic exhaust velocity of LOx/LH is 2435m/s\nthe natural log of (12 tons (full) divided by 2 tons (empty tanks + capsule and engines) is 1.79175946923\n\n2435 m/s * 1.7917 is 4363 meters/second once the fuel is all burned\n\nsounds fast, doesn't it?  but the speed of light is 300,000 meters/second.\n\nSo lets build another bigger rocket that will take our 12 ton rocket, and boost it, using a big tank of fuel and more rocket engines, say 6 tons of engines and tank, and 60 tons of LOx/LH\n\nExhaust velocity is the same 2435 but now that empty tanks mass is 12 tons for the original capsule with rocket and engines, plus 6 more tons of tanks and rockets on the new booster, so the natural log (or ln for short) of 78/18 is 1.4662\n\nso  2435 m/s * 1.4662 is 3570 m/s added to our velocity at first stage burnout\n\nFuel is the limiter.\n\nThink about driving a car across a desert (no gas stations).  How much gas could you practically carry?  And that Gas is not weightless--your car would be slower and less efficient with the additional fuel loaded onboard\n\nThat is why we can't go super freaking fast--every way you have ever watched NASA or any other space agency or company launch has rockets that have to run out of fuel (no cheat codes for infinite fuel!)\n\nOkay, chemical rockets suck. What else can you do.\n\n1. Nuclear. \nChucking bombs out the back end of a Orion type spaceship, pushing the ship forward when they are exploded.\nRunning Hydrogen over the hot surface of a nuclear reactor core and exhausting the superheated Hydrogen gas out the tailpipe\n\n2. Ion/Plasma\nZapping a gas with electricity or microwaves to strip off some electrons (making a gas of 'ions' or an ionized gas) and accelerating those ions using electromagnetic fields\n\nOkay those are great, and more efficient, but Nuclear is not popular, and ion engines are incredibly efficient, but accelerate very slowly.\n\nWhat if you didn't bring the fuel with you?\n\nSolar Sails, using the Sun's light, or using a large laser to bounce photons (light) off a reflective surface (the sail).  Light has no mass, but it does have momentum, which can be transferred to an object.  So Light can push the sail.  \n\nThe concept to use a large number of powerful lasers to push a sail to Proxima Centauri (the nearest star to our Sun) has been proposed.\n\nThe problem with sails is that light intensity drops off by the distance squared.  So if you are twice the distance away, you get a quarter (1/2^2) of the light, and three times away you get a ninth (1/3^3) of the light\n\nSo there are some suggestions that there are some corners of Physics we don't understand completely yet, and might allow a propellentless drive (see the EM drive) however, the thrust of these devices seem to be tiny tiny tiny.\n\nI hope this helps.\n \n",

We've never needed anything remotely approaching the 25 Mb/s rate that the article states qualifies as 'high-speed broadband'.  Our service was 4 Mb/s until we dumped cable TV a couple of years ago and assumed that we'd need more access quota (not more bandwidth:  4 Mb/s is plenty to stream video in standard-definition quality, though about double that would be desirable for high-definition) to watch a good deal of TV over the Internet but in fact turned out not to watch much at all.  Save when downloading the free 3 GB Windows 10 upgrades recently the additional bandwidth and access quota have been of little value to us, but as the price difference is only an additional $11/month we haven't returned to the 4 Mb/s (actually, now 5 Mb/s) plan and have stuck with the 15 Mb/s (actually, it turns out that it's now 35 Mb/s:  they do keep increasing their bandwidths without noticeably increasing costs) plan.\n\n2.  NetZero advertises up to 6 Mb/s DSL service for $14/month, which while hardly leading-edge should be sufficient for most normal use (though if DSL still requires the home to be within a few miles of the nearest telephone substation that could be a problem).\n\n3.  GoDaddy advertises web-hosting-plus-domain service for $8/month (current promo price is half that), which could well satisfy Curtis Brown's business needs and offer plenty of bandwidth for his customers' use even if he had to use an ancient dial-up line to access it himself (admittedly a pain) if DSL service is not available to him.\n\nI'm certainly not going to go on about how we made do with 300 baud modems back when home computing was done in caves but neither is anything at all close to top-of-the-line Internet access necessary for most of the things normal people want to do with the possible exception of some unusually exacting video games or extreme bulk data movement.",

But since you're so hung up on it, let me put it this way: Okabe was trying to fix mistakes he made. He was undoing every dmail to fix the problems in the world he had caused. If you want nobility how's that for you? Not that Okabe is noble, he's a regular guy dealing with extraordinaire and terrible situations. Disgusting? Well, it isn't heroic, no. But I think you're judging him unfairly. Consider if it were yourself. Judge him as a human being not some noble knight who always does right. He's a human being and you'd do the same thing. If someone shot your significant other dead and told you it was to save the world from disaster would you say ok and leave it at that? I sincerely doubt it. I have seen Code Geass, it's a great show, but Okabe and Lelouch are nothing alike. The idea that you think Okabe only cares for one person(or Lelouch as well) shows you know neither of them well at all. Okabe loves every one of his friends deeply and sincerely, his friendships are everything to him. Mayuri, Daru, Kurisu, Lukako, Faris, Suzuha, and even Moeka, are all very important to him, who wishes for friends above anything else. Without going into spoilers, suffice it to say realizing he cared for more than one person was a significant part of Lelouch's character progression. Furthermore Lelouch was in many ways a unique person, Okabe is not. Lelouch had resolve nearing inhuman levels and an immortal witch to console him when his heart did falter, and an intellect that could scarely be rivaled by anyone, he was perhaps one of the most intelligent human beings to have ever existed. By contrast Okabe is a very ordinary kid. He is above average intelligence, but he's not all that special. You shouldn't judge him like he should be more than human, that isn't fair.",

But there it's also unnecessary to try and create new terms when others already exist.  People who experience multiple genders concurrently have identified as bi-gendered, tri-gendered, two spirit, etc.  People who identify as genderless have identified as agender, genderless, and sometimes nuetrois, genderqueer, or just androgynous (but those have also been used to describe a state of gender neutrality as well).  If people are going to string together terms to describe their experience then they should be accurate.  To say that you are \"without gender\" and then also say \"I am a girl\" is a contradiction.  If they experience multiple genders and they want to communicate that then should. \n\nIt's interesting to see your interpretation of 'cafab' and 'afab'.  A point of history.  Those terms were both taken from the intersex community and mean essentially the same thing.  One just clarifies the users perspective that being assigned that sex, in this case female, was forced on them and was intensely negative and harmful (a coercive act).  \n\nI don't understand why there is any reason or point to identify as \"male-loyal\" unless your coming from a space that is populated with people that has a number of people who are intensely anti-male.  I know that in some radical feminist circles that can happen because of some extreme feminist theory that cites \"males\" as the sole reason for female oppression and claims that *all* males are inherently oppressive.  Not an awesome philosophy by the way.... \n\nI've seen transmasculine used by people who maybe weren't comfortable IDing with \"trans man\" because its carried the implication of medical transition and that wasn't something that they wanted.  I have never seen it used by someone who ID's as \"politically male-aligned\" and I honestly don't even know what that means. The 'tm' in 'ftm' stands for \"... to male\" and is used by people who are physically and socially transitioning to male.  It does not stand for \"transmasculine\".  \n\nAs a side note, I think it makes perfect sense for someone who only feels the need to transition socially, and not physically, to ID as 'trans masculine' or 'trans feminine' as opposed to IDing as a 'trans man' or 'trans woman', just my perspective.  \n\n\"Agender butch\" doesn't inherently misgender a masculine agender afab person, though I could see how it could come across that way and simply calling them butch is probably insensitive to their experience.  \n\nI'd like to point out that \"non-binary girl\" is also a contradiction, like \"agender girl\".  You can be a gender non-conforming girl / woman (like myself and many other women out there), but when you cross into non-binary you're moving outside of, or beyond,  binary gender.  \"Girl\" is inherently binary, and to take it into non-binary genders shows a lack of respect for binary gender identities when there are a myriad of other terms to use to describe your experience.  \n\nThe way I'm coming to understand all of these various experiences is this; we have multi-gendered people, gender fluid people, genderless people, and gendered people.  Within each of those categories of experience we have all of these various terms, and none of them are mutually exclusive with ones expression of traits that are called \"masculine\" or \"feminine\" in western culture.

If they experience multiple genders and they want to communicate that then should. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s interesting to see your interpretation of &amp;#39;cafab&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;afab&amp;#39;.  A point of history.  Those terms were both taken from the intersex community and mean essentially the same thing.  One just clarifies the users perspective that being assigned that sex, in this case female, was forced on them and was intensely negative and harmful (a coercive act).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand why there is any reason or point to identify as &amp;quot;male-loyal&amp;quot; unless your coming from a space that is populated with people that has a number of people who are intensely anti-male.  I know that in some radical feminist circles that can happen because of some extreme feminist theory that cites &amp;quot;males&amp;quot; as the sole reason for female oppression and claims that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; males are inherently oppressive.  Not an awesome philosophy by the way.... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen transmasculine used by people who maybe weren&amp;#39;t comfortable IDing with &amp;quot;trans man&amp;quot; because its carried the implication of medical transition and that wasn&amp;#39;t something that they wanted.  I have never seen it used by someone who ID&amp;#39;s as &amp;quot;politically male-aligned&amp;quot; and I honestly don&amp;#39;t even know what that means. The &amp;#39;tm&amp;#39; in &amp;#39;ftm&amp;#39; stands for &amp;quot;... to male&amp;quot; and is used by people who are physically and socially transitioning to male.  It does not stand for &amp;quot;transmasculine&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I think it makes perfect sense for someone who only feels the need to transition socially, and not physically, to ID as &amp;#39;trans masculine&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;trans feminine&amp;#39; as opposed to IDing as a &amp;#39;trans man&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;trans woman&amp;#39;, just my perspective.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Agender butch&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t inherently misgender a masculine agender afab person, though I could see how it could come across that way and simply calling them butch is probably insensitive to their experience.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to point out that &amp;quot;non-binary girl&amp;quot; is also a contradiction, like &amp;quot;agender girl&amp;quot;.  You can be a gender non-conforming girl / woman (like myself and many other women out there), but when you cross into non-binary you&amp;#39;re moving outside of, or beyond,  binary gender.  &amp;quot;Girl&amp;quot; is inherently binary, and to take it into non-binary genders shows a lack of respect for binary gender identities when there are a myriad of other terms to use to describe your experience.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way I&amp;#39;m coming to understand all of these various experiences is this; we have multi-gendered people, gender fluid people, genderless people, and gendered people.  Within each of those categories of experience we have all of these various terms, and none of them are mutually exclusive with ones expression of traits that are called &amp;quot;masculine&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;feminine&amp;quot; in western culture.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "OP I felt similar to you after finishing Bake, but after finishing the series it's become my favorite franchise purely for the characters. \n\nMonogatari is all about the relationships the MC has with each character (at least before the plot gets crazy like it does later). There is just too much information in Bake to notice everything you need to notice. You miss so much about the characters since you're struggling to keep up with wtf is going on.\n\nJust to expand on some things /u/Seraphaestus mentioned.\n\nSenjougahara basically has asperger's at the moment and you should just treat her like an autistic kid. She's been emotionless for 2 years and now has problems displaying her emotions. Remember in the first episode Araragi mentions that all she does is read? She flat out says I'm a tsundere, and she guesses Oshino is a moe character because of his name. That's how her thought process works at the moment - she can only relate her emotions to things she's been reading about for the past 2 years. There's a lot more to her character that makes her much more interesting (she's one of my favorite anime chars) but hope that addresses why she's all batshit crazy in bake.\n\n\n[Hachikuji ](/s \"her job as a lost snail oddity is to get people who don't want to go home lost\") however she doesn't like this so she actively tried (literally and metaphorically) to push people she met away. [Read the lyrics to her second OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJBb4nVhtjs).\n\n&gt;Lost but not at a loss  \n&gt;I met you  \n&gt;As you pretend to tease and bother me  \n&gt;I pretend to be a little angry  \n&gt;And savor the mundane joy.\n\nThe groping started when she lamented how he was her first touch so he responded with \"oh yeah? I'll grope you so hard you won't care about that.\" It's all just playful banter between the two, nothing sexual. Notice how after Nadeko's arc when Nadeko is thanking him he tries to playfully lift her skirt (he stops before he actually does). She doesn't react though and he stops messing with her after that.\n\nJust like /u/Seraphaestus said, Nadeko is generic on purpose, watch her later arc when she becomes awesome.\n\nHanekawa is pretty generic on purpose also, except they hint that there's more to it at the end.\n\nHopefully both our walls of text are enough to atleast convince you that the characters aren't utter trash and you give the rest a shot. Just to warn you though Nisemonogatari is more of a thematic stand alone season compared to the rest. It doesn't focus on the overarching plot aside from introducing important characters so a lot of people consider it filler or don't like it (which is a shame) also the fanservice is in overdrive and it's probably going to be like pulling teeth for you. It's worth it though to get to monogatari second season.",

There is just too much information in Bake to notice everything you need to notice. You miss so much about the characters since you&amp;#39;re struggling to keep up with wtf is going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just to expand on some things &lt;a href=\"/u/Seraphaestus\"&gt;/u/Seraphaestus&lt;/a&gt; mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Senjougahara basically has asperger&amp;#39;s at the moment and you should just treat her like an autistic kid. She&amp;#39;s been emotionless for 2 years and now has problems displaying her emotions. Remember in the first episode Araragi mentions that all she does is read? She flat out says I&amp;#39;m a tsundere, and she guesses Oshino is a moe character because of his name. That&amp;#39;s how her thought process works at the moment - she can only relate her emotions to things she&amp;#39;s been reading about for the past 2 years. There&amp;#39;s a lot more to her character that makes her much more interesting (she&amp;#39;s one of my favorite anime chars) but hope that addresses why she&amp;#39;s all batshit crazy in bake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"her job as a lost snail oddity is to get people who don&amp;#39;t want to go home lost\"&gt;Hachikuji &lt;/a&gt; however she doesn&amp;#39;t like this so she actively tried (literally and metaphorically) to push people she met away. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJBb4nVhtjs\"&gt;Read the lyrics to her second OP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lost but not at a loss&lt;br/&gt;\nI met you&lt;br/&gt;\nAs you pretend to tease and bother me&lt;br/&gt;\nI pretend to be a little angry&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd savor the mundane joy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The groping started when she lamented how he was her first touch so he responded with &amp;quot;oh yeah? I&amp;#39;ll grope you so hard you won&amp;#39;t care about that.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s all just playful banter between the two, nothing sexual. Notice how after Nadeko&amp;#39;s arc when Nadeko is thanking him he tries to playfully lift her skirt (he stops before he actually does). She doesn&amp;#39;t react though and he stops messing with her after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like &lt;a href=\"/u/Seraphaestus\"&gt;/u/Seraphaestus&lt;/a&gt; said, Nadeko is generic on purpose, watch her later arc when she becomes awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hanekawa is pretty generic on purpose also, except they hint that there&amp;#39;s more to it at the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully both our walls of text are enough to atleast convince you that the characters aren&amp;#39;t utter trash and you give the rest a shot. Just to warn you though Nisemonogatari is more of a thematic stand alone season compared to the rest. It doesn&amp;#39;t focus on the overarching plot aside from introducing important characters so a lot of people consider it filler or don&amp;#39;t like it (which is a shame) also the fanservice is in overdrive and it&amp;#39;s probably going to be like pulling teeth for you. It&amp;#39;s worth it though to get to monogatari second season.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

                "body": "Of course, you're perfectly entitled to your own opinion on Bakemonogatari, especially with a show as polarising as the Monogatari series, but I'd like to share/argue what I like about the show. I personally think you have the characters mischaracterised, and I don't like your other gripes.\n\nThe main thing is the characters. Senjougahara (the main girl) starts off being a typical 'violent tsundere'. This is because she's trying to push everyone away from her so they don't find out about her low weight because of the Weight Crab. As the series progresses, her insults to Araragi become affectionate to the point that they aren't nearly as common nor abrasive, and she stops being physically violent.\n\nHachikuji (the lost, little girl) I don't have as strong a case against your interpretation, but I do think she is a nice character and is more of a character for Araragi to interact with and play off, really. I don't like the groping bits either, they were one of my major gripes with the show, but again they aren't *as* prevalant later on and Hachikuji even points out to Araragi that she doesn't mind and it's really just a performance/play between them (when he tells her he's seen the error of his ways). Again, I know this doesn't justify it but it's something I can overlook given it's not completely non-conformant with Araragi's characterisation, isn't too prevalant, and is justified between the characters.\n\nNadeko (the \"I have feelings for onii-chan\" girl) is meant to be generic, this is actually quite an important part of her character and it gets developed on in her next arc. I personally like her design, though!\n\nRegarding Hanekawa (\"big-boobed cat girl\"), it's important to remember that we view the series through the narrator, Araragi,'s eyes, which is why there's a small focus on Hanekawa being \"the ideal woman\", aesthetically, because that is what she is to Araragi. She's the ideal he feels he could never be good enough for, and ultimately stopped pursuing because of that. This is also quite interesting as a part of Hanekawa's development is about how she feels like she has to hold herself up to ridiculous standards, yet feels she is actually very selfish. She hates that people think she's perfect, and she liked Araragi at first because he treated her rather normally, though eventually he came to see her as the perfect woman.\n\nI don't like the fanservice either, but I went into that with it being from Araragi's viewpoint. I think a lot of the fanservice is questionable and I would rather be without, but there's also a lot that isn't so bad. The panty shot scene you're referring to is from the very start of the series (Kizumonogatari) and is when Araragi, at that time a loner who pretends \"having friends will lower [his] intensity as a human\", meets Hanekawa who, against his protests, becomes his friend. So I think the fanservice in that scene was meant to be a parody of similar scenes in other material, maybe?\n\nThe story isn't really meant to be interesting in the way I think you mean. Monogatari is a character driven show at heart. It has some enjoyable action at times (see Suruga Monkey fight, Nisemonogatari final fight and fight with Karen) but if character driven plotlines and interactions don't appeal to you, the show just probably isn't for you. I also think that's the case if you don't like the \"slides\"/artsy presentation of it. Besides the fact that it's not necessary to view the still frames (which have sentences from the point of view of characters to (briefly) show what's going on their heads, not \"deep quotes\"), I never really found it annoying. At least if you do, it's much less prevalant as the series goes on, since in Bakemonogatari a lot of the artsy direction is due to having a low budget, I believe.\n\nAt least we can certainly agree on the music, haha. I really like Renai Circulation, and it has a nice companion in Mousou Express which is the OP for the second Nadeko arc; I'd suggest listening to it if you liked Renai Circulation.",

        "body": "That's the thing about morality though - it varies personally and culturally. For instance, you mentioned Brahma married his own daughter. Personally, that's not something I can get behind, and I'm sure there's a lot of folks that would agree overall. Some people think that falls into a moral gray [or even white] area because it's a god, and there are different rules. And there are fringe groups that think that's perfectly fine regardless of who you are. None of that's really important.\n\nBefore I make my point, I'm not religious, but I respect people's right to be religious. People can believe whatever they want, I don't care. My point is, and we'll choose the Christian god here, that god is a magnificent benefactor full of infinite love, wisdom, compassion, etc. Going new testament here for the sake of convenience, before god's great remix in the old testament, he was kind of a dick.\n\nSo you ask people who is god, they say he's the father of all life and being, he's infinite love, compassion, etc. So you ask how they know, they say because it's in a book and everybody knows that. If you keep going with that, it boils down to \"because god said so.\" I mean, I can come up to you on the street and say that I'm an eccentric billionaire and I want to make your day by giving you $10,000,000, but you have to spend the next 20 years doing nice shit for people, respecting your neighbors, generally not being a dick, etc. If you're like me, you'll probably get a good laugh and carry on about your business. If not, you're taking me at face value over something I said, as a complete stranger on the street, and assuming that it's going to happen. \n\nSo ultimately my point was that assuming god exists, and assuming that the bible [in this instance] is an accurate documentation of the life and times of god and early civilization, we really need to take a second to say \"says fucking who?\" There was a really great Twilight Zone episode where these guys end up stranded on a remote planet, and one of them finds this civilization of tiny little people, and they say \"Oh shit, it's god! Awesome!\" and then start immediately serving/worshipping him. It's pretty clear that the god complex in that example is a matter of circumstances, as in \"You're bigger than me, I can't figure out why, want a free statue?\" So ultimately, assuming god exists, it's kinda irresponsible to just take him/her/it/that/etc. at it's word. How about some fucking references, or some proof, or some actual good deeds to *prove* the mysterious space benefactor angle? Because as I see it, as a non-believer but still open to the idea, all we've got now is hearsay and weird diseases.\n\nThe other point, that god is dead, goes off the assumption that god at least existed at one point, but doesn't anymore. Look at the bible, there haven't been any additions to it in a *pretty* long time. All kinds of awesome shit was happening in the bible - wars between heaven and hell, divine espionage, burning bushes that said stuff, talking snakes, the heavens and earth moving on a whim, direct communication, etc. What happened between now and then? As human civilization advanced through the years, god hasn't really been in the picture, nor has satan, or any of the other fantastic shit going on back then. My argument is that if god and the gang existed, they're either dead, forgot about us, or willfully abandoned us. Look at the world around you. Science and medicine have lead to overpopulation, wars are being fought over shit people are finding in the ground and who's god can beat up who's god, kids are born with cancer, insects lay eggs in people's eyes and brains, etc. It's not exactly the thriving utopia we were promised, and god hasn't said fuck all to anyone except the clinically insane. That's also kind of a big deal.\n\nSo to summarize, I'm not trying to say \"religion is stupid and people should think otherwise,\" I'm trying to say maybe we need to analyze religion in the modern world and why god/s aren't as involved as they used to be.",

Science and medicine have lead to overpopulation, wars are being fought over shit people are finding in the ground and who&amp;#39;s god can beat up who&amp;#39;s god, kids are born with cancer, insects lay eggs in people&amp;#39;s eyes and brains, etc. It&amp;#39;s not exactly the thriving utopia we were promised, and god hasn&amp;#39;t said fuck all to anyone except the clinically insane. That&amp;#39;s also kind of a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to summarize, I&amp;#39;m not trying to say &amp;quot;religion is stupid and people should think otherwise,&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m trying to say maybe we need to analyze religion in the modern world and why god/s aren&amp;#39;t as involved as they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

She&amp;#39;s naked in that cutscene until you turn around.\"&gt;Spoilers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think your version is fine. If you&amp;#39;re on PC then download an end game save and go to a brothel in Novigrad. If it is censored then obviously those sex scenes must be blocked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you actually &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; a censored version then I don&amp;#39;t know how to help except to say(hopefully not rudely) : This game wasn&amp;#39;t made with censorship in mind. It&amp;#39;s 18+. Maybe look for some mods? Or skip those scenes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck! And if a censored version does exist and you got that one by mistake then you should definitely get it replaced or... Pirate the uncensored game(you already paid for it so imo, it&amp;#39;s OK).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tbh, I don&amp;#39;t think a censored version even exists. There would be a LOT of things that would need to be censored.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

        "body": "I will copy and paste some of my comments from other posts which I hope you might find helpful...\n\nA design in the steam workshop by the name of \"customizable destroyer\" by \"16littlejay\" does a great job with everything I will attempt to explain. \n\nA metal hull is a solid way to go as it provides far more protection than wood and light allow armor, while it is much lighter and less expensive than heavy armor. Make sure your ship is wide enough to keep it form rolling over and flipping.  Try to design it so that it is hydrodynamic. \n\nKeep the bottom of the ship heavy with stone or lead  blocks if necessary so that the center of mass is low. In build mode you will be able to see this and it is key you pay attention to it. Also place thrust directly behind the center of mass for the best ship speed. \n\nAir pumps remove water and are the best way to increase buoyancy and require that the hull be sealed off from the water  for them to work (they will tell you if the hull is breached or not).  It is very helpful to partition the hull into smaller segments so that a single hull breach will flood the ship. In 16littlejay's design the hull of the ship is 3 metal blocks thick, but there are spaces in between the armor which have air pumps in them. This allows for a heavily armored, yet buoyant ship. Using wood for internal areas where armor is not a necessity will help to increase buoyancy as well. When moving through the water hydrofoils can be employed to lift the ship higher and increase the top speed.  Really my only critique of his design is that it could be slight wider. \n\nIt is actually a good thing of the ships rides low in the water because water offers your ship great protection. I try to keep my deck about 3-4m above the water line if that. If you are still having trouble with bouncy perhaps you are using too much armor?  \n\nAs far as advanced cannons, I like to have one turret that shoots smaller faster projectiles capable of penetrating through an entire ship assuming no shields. This can be done with a slightly smaller gauge than used with explosive shells while still using 1-3m clips. This will allow for enough gunpowder casing to get a fast shell velocity. I like to use a sabot head and body, and a normal body.  These cannons will shred non-shielded enemies as they will seemingly ignore armor and punch right through to ammo storage and AI.  To get a faster fire rate use a shit load of belt fed autoloaders and coolers, more barrels and recoil absorbers are important as well. \n\nFor explosive advanced cannons, I prefer a gauge of 250-500mm and 2-3m long clips. I like to keep these shells at lower speeds (around 200-400) m/s so they have a greater chance of penetrating shields. I like to use a shaped charge head and 1-2 HE bodies depending on the size of a shell. I usually end the shell with the a piece that explodes after a certain level of armor penetration or angular deflection (I forget what they are called).  Also check out the graviton ram attachment it could be very useful. \n\nI think the two. most important parts of building an advanced cannon is making efficient use of space (look at some designs of turrets on ships of steam workshop for this). And secondly, armoring your turrets well both above as bellow deck. The work thing that can happen is your turrets exploding below deck and causing a chain reaction bc internal armor is too weak. \n\nAs far as engines go, basically injectors are the best way to add power, but at a cost to efficiency, and always have exhaust going outside the vehicle. You can now place prefab engines ((called riptide I think) and if you click on it there are beginning middle and end segments so that you can make your engine as big as you want)) that I like a lot, they have good power and efficiency so just study those. \n\nHere is the link to my ship I built using the customizable destroyer hull design. I've done a lot of work on it since so I'll try to update the design soon. Hopefully it might give you a good idea of some of the stuff I was talking about. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=755980460\n\nHope this helps. ",
        "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will copy and paste some of my comments from other posts which I hope you might find helpful...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A design in the steam workshop by the name of &amp;quot;customizable destroyer&amp;quot; by &amp;quot;16littlejay&amp;quot; does a great job with everything I will attempt to explain. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A metal hull is a solid way to go as it provides far more protection than wood and light allow armor, while it is much lighter and less expensive than heavy armor. Make sure your ship is wide enough to keep it form rolling over and flipping.  Try to design it so that it is hydrodynamic. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep the bottom of the ship heavy with stone or lead  blocks if necessary so that the center of mass is low. In build mode you will be able to see this and it is key you pay attention to it. Also place thrust directly behind the center of mass for the best ship speed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Air pumps remove water and are the best way to increase buoyancy and require that the hull be sealed off from the water  for them to work (they will tell you if the hull is breached or not).  It is very helpful to partition the hull into smaller segments so that a single hull breach will flood the ship. In 16littlejay&amp;#39;s design the hull of the ship is 3 metal blocks thick, but there are spaces in between the armor which have air pumps in them. This allows for a heavily armored, yet buoyant ship. Using wood for internal areas where armor is not a necessity will help to increase buoyancy as well. When moving through the water hydrofoils can be employed to lift the ship higher and increase the top speed.  Really my only critique of his design is that it could be slight wider. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is actually a good thing of the ships rides low in the water because water offers your ship great protection. I try to keep my deck about 3-4m above the water line if that. If you are still having trouble with bouncy perhaps you are using too much armor?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as advanced cannons, I like to have one turret that shoots smaller faster projectiles capable of penetrating through an entire ship assuming no shields. This can be done with a slightly smaller gauge than used with explosive shells while still using 1-3m clips. This will allow for enough gunpowder casing to get a fast shell velocity. I like to use a sabot head and body, and a normal body.  These cannons will shred non-shielded enemies as they will seemingly ignore armor and punch right through to ammo storage and AI.  To get a faster fire rate use a shit load of belt fed autoloaders and coolers, more barrels and recoil absorbers are important as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For explosive advanced cannons, I prefer a gauge of 250-500mm and 2-3m long clips. I like to keep these shells at lower speeds (around 200-400) m/s so they have a greater chance of penetrating shields. I like to use a shaped charge head and 1-2 HE bodies depending on the size of a shell. I usually end the shell with the a piece that explodes after a certain level of armor penetration or angular deflection (I forget what they are called).  Also check out the graviton ram attachment it could be very useful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the two. most important parts of building an advanced cannon is making efficient use of space (look at some designs of turrets on ships of steam workshop for this). And secondly, armoring your turrets well both above as bellow deck. The work thing that can happen is your turrets exploding below deck and causing a chain reaction bc internal armor is too weak. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as engines go, basically injectors are the best way to add power, but at a cost to efficiency, and always have exhaust going outside the vehicle. You can now place prefab engines ((called riptide I think) and if you click on it there are beginning middle and end segments so that you can make your engine as big as you want)) that I like a lot, they have good power and efficiency so just study those. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the link to my ship I built using the customizable destroyer hull design. I&amp;#39;ve done a lot of work on it since so I&amp;#39;ll try to update the design soon. Hopefully it might give you a good idea of some of the stuff I was talking about. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=755980460\"&gt;http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=755980460&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

This is not even mentioning that things like rocket sleds and space elevators might actually work on Mars. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: As I&amp;#39;m sure someone has thought before, launches from Mars would be even more efficient because you can design your rocket engines to be close to vacuum engines from launch - Mars only has around 1% of Earth&amp;#39;s sea-level atmospheric pressure at it&amp;#39;s surface.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

Are they just, really broad meaning ones or just ones where &amp;quot;Oh you thought this is all it could do?  well guess what, heres yet another feature&amp;quot;  and it keeps doing that over and over and over?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as for part 7, I think someone said that its kind of stand-alone ish.   If thats true, could I just read that before doing 5 and 6?

You have ongoing anxiety issues, you're trying to finish a degree when you're already burnt out, and you're going through the difficult process of cutting some toxic people out of your life. I've noticed lately that you've been eating high-carb junk food to induce a carb coma and escape from your problems. This is what you used to do at your heaviest. I know you're strict about not going over your maintenance number but health is more than just weight. It's important to feel good as well. \n\nMake lists, keep seeking help for your anxiety, and you'll get through these difficulties, one day at a time. Your reward for reaching your goal weight is getting seriously into exercise and experiencing all of its anxiety-soothing endorphins.

However I will try and answer this question from a Gaudiya Vaishnav (a school of Hinduism) perspective.

The question arises, \"Why should I *worship* God as opposed ignoring Him and living my life?\".\n\nTo this I would respond as follows. We living beings are driven to act via our desires. We act in certain ways and not others, and this suggests an object/s of desire that is/are an end in itself. Now, Hindu philosophy suggests there are three suitable ends for desire. They are:\n\n1) *survival* (we want to extend life as opposed to end it)\n2) *knowledge* (we are curious to learn rather than forget) \n3) *pleasure* (we are inclined to pleasure rather than pain). \n\nThese three fundamental desires, which are verily the root of all desires, cannot be fulfilled by anything other than God, for God is the origin of these desires and therefore only an All Powerful God can fulfill them. At present we are separated and disconnected from God (we do not have a relationship with Him). The only way to have a relationship with God is by approaching Him and pleasing Him, and this is done through the process of worship. Hindu scripture says that *bhakti adhoksaje, ahaituki apratihata yena atma suprasidari* (only devotional service to God, which is causeless and ceaseless is able to satisfy the soul). This in turn arises from the understanding that we (and all things in this universe) are created in the service of God only, and they reach their full perfection (and fulfillment) only in His service.

But the guy who has nigh 0 effect on others shows devotion in his own way with a life that is his own and can do with it what he wishes according to the religion, that&amp;#39;s complete evil?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see how Good and Evil are completely subjective now? Keep your generalizations and holier than thou attitude to yourself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll just leave you with one last comment before I let you return to wallowing in the shallow little bubble of reality you&amp;#39;ve constructed for yourself. You never have Buddhists going on Reddit and telling Christians their Religion is evil for having created the crusades, throwing themselves to war in the name of their religion. Which was as far back as this mummification was. At least the Buddhist in this case wasn&amp;#39;t taking thousands of lives that did not belong to him, besides the one he actually owned. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",

There tends to be a natural upper limit for how fast a piston can be moving, and at the same rpm an engine with a longer stroke will have its pistons moving at a greater average speed to complete each cycle. The interesting thing is that the maximum MPS (mean piston speed) of the highest revving NA engines of various sizes all tend to be close to 25 meters per second. That's why high revving engines go with a larger bore:stroke ratio, so they can maintain a desirable cylinder displacement while still having a stratospheric redline. Of course, a short stroke engine with a mean piston speed of 25 m/s at 15,000 rpm would have to accelerate and change directions over a much shorter distance and time than a long stroke one at 7000 rpm, so the G's would be much higher.

There tends to be a natural upper limit for how fast a piston can be moving, and at the same rpm an engine with a longer stroke will have its pistons moving at a greater average speed to complete each cycle. The interesting thing is that the maximum MPS (mean piston speed) of the highest revving NA engines of various sizes all tend to be close to 25 meters per second. That&amp;#39;s why high revving engines go with a larger bore:stroke ratio, so they can maintain a desirable cylinder displacement while still having a stratospheric redline. Of course, a short stroke engine with a mean piston speed of 25 m/s at 15,000 rpm would have to accelerate and change directions over a much shorter distance and time than a long stroke one at 7000 rpm, so the G&amp;#39;s would be much higher. But it would also have much smaller and lighter pistons so the con-rods won&amp;#39;t have as much inertial force to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;",
