Either way it will take anything from 15-100 days.\n\n**EDIT 2 :** Ok [this site](http://www.net-flatrate.de/dsl-rechner.php) says it takes 163 seconds for 1 gb of data (with a 50k kbit connection). 3600/163 is around 22. So we have 22 gb upload every hour, this times 24 is 530 gb every day. 15.000 gb / 530 gb are 28 days. \n\nIm not really sure that the upload rate is realistic, seems way to fast. With a 16k connection i have a upload around 1mb and a 4 times faster connection should be aroun 4mb and not 10. So even with that fast of an connection, it would take close under one month to upload 15.000 gb of data.

At the very least I'm interested in trying almost all fetish related play but I'm especially fond of D/s dynamics (CEI is my *favorite*), Sissification, Foot fetish, and any roleplay. **I offer multi-seller kik sessions, kik me (laineylactate) me for availability.** As for the D/s dynamics, I am a fairly firm Domme however given the right buyer or DD/lg I will play switch.\n\n**Here's my list of interests and fetishes:**\n \n* Squirting\n* Multi-seller kik sessions\n* Foot worship/hypnosis/fetish\n* B/G Play\n* Domination\n* Humiliation\n* Sissification\n* Forced Intoxication\n* Tasks\n* JOI/JOE\n* Strip tease\n* Roleplay\n* Edging\n* Dress up\n* Chastity/Keyholding\n* Squidplay\n* Cuckholding\n* Any mailed items (socks/panties/bras/ect)\n* Lactation (I'm not longer lactating, premade content)\n* MUCH MUCH more... \n\n**I'm available for:** \n\n* Kik Sessions\n* Custom and Premade Videos\n* Live cam/skype\n* GFE\n* Custom Photo Sets\n* Custom shipped items\n* Dick/Cumshot Ratings (text and video)\n\n**Of course I show face you silly boys!**\n\nI take almost every form of payment but bitcoin or google wallet work best for me! The best place to reach me is via **kik**, my username is **LaineyLactate**. I'm on EST and the best times to reach be are between 1pm-5am, but you can kik me any time of the day, I just may be slow to respond if I'm busy or asleep.\n\n**Disclaimer:** If you decide on a kik session, cam show, or GFE please make your expectations and requests clear before making payment so that I'm ready to accommodate them. While I'm open to suggestions and requests during the kik session, I will only give you one warning when you are pushing my boundaries, making unreasonable requests, or being rude. A second infraction will terminate our agreement without refund.\n\n[Do you have experience developing subreddits?](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaineyLove/comments/54n1x4/looking_for_help_developingmanaging_this_subreddit/)\n", "id": "d8966ny", "report_reasons": null, "author_flair_text": "Trusted Seller", "removal_reason": null, "parent_id": "t3_55bij9", "edited": false, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "stickied": false}, {"body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erased, i dont know if satoru or kenya are attractive for girls or not but none of the females feel attractive to me at all (and yes that includes &lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"Adult Hinazuki\"&gt;Erased&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also Kamichu, i feel the show arent trying to make the design attractive at all, the characters feels really....normal....that or i&amp;#39;m just not used for old character design&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_55bd0c", "score_hidden": false, "ups": -13, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "MAL", "created": 1475320023.0, "archived": false, "likes": null, "banned_by": null, "saved": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "downs": 0, "author": "hexanort", "created_utc": 1475291223.0, "score": -13, "name": "t1_d8967ql", "controversiality": 0, "chain": [], "user_reports": [], "approved_by": null, "num_reports": null, "subreddit": "anime", "body": "Erased, i dont know if satoru or kenya are attractive for girls or not but none of the females feel attractive to me at all (and yes that includes [Erased](/s \"Adult Hinazuki\") )\n\nAlso Kamichu, i feel the show arent trying to make the design attractive at all, the characters feels really....normal....that or i'm just not used for old character design", "id": "d8967ql", "report_reasons": null, "author_flair_text": "myanimelist.net/animelist/hexanort", "removal_reason": null, "parent_id": "t3_55bd0c", "edited": false, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "stickied": false}, {"body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because a post doesn&amp;#39;t have a /s on it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s not sarcastic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_555k4t", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_css_class": "text-darkmoon", "created": 1475320140.0, "archived": false, "likes": null, "banned_by": null, "saved": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2w3z3", "downs": 0, "author": "pocketlint60", "created_utc": 1475291340.0, "score": 1, "name": "t1_d896a0v", "controversiality": 0, "chain": [{"body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excellent analysis man.

So if you are twice the distance away, you get a quarter (1/2^2) of the light, and three times away you get a ninth (1/3^3) of the light\n\nSo there are some suggestions that there are some corners of Physics we don't understand completely yet, and might allow a propellentless drive (see the EM drive) however, the thrust of these devices seem to be tiny tiny tiny.\n\nI hope this helps.\n \n", "id": "d896elr", "report_reasons": null, "author_flair_text": null, "removal_reason": null, "parent_id": "t1_d894zy0", "edited": false, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "stickied": false}, {"body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mob has a Hulk-esque feel when he uses his powers rather than someone holding back despite its truth. &lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"When he got attacked via his brain he technically had his first loss or draw rather so I wouldn&amp;#39;t exactly call him strong of mind.\"&gt;Mob Psycho 100&lt;/a&gt;  Mob has OP powers, but he is generally weak in execution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_55ba80", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 1, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "created": 1475320459.0, "archived": false, "likes": null, "banned_by": null, "saved": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "downs": 0, "author": "Rawliez", "created_utc": 1475291659.0, "score": 1, "name": "t1_d896gm3", "controversiality": 0, "chain": [{"body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Punch Man&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;Perfectly timed comedy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;Saitama gives the viewers what they want&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;Plot entices viewers appetite for more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;Predictable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;Flat characters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;Overall plot has little substance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mob Psycho 100&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;Characterization is on point&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;Half-decent plot&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;MC is realistic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;Weak MC(&lt;em&gt;Anti-violence&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;Somewhat predictable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t fully utilize MC fight-winning satisification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_55ba80", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 2, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "created": 1475317506.0, "archived": false, "likes": null, "banned_by": null, "saved": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "downs": 0, "author": "Rawliez", "created_utc": 1475288706.0, "score": 2, "name": "t1_d894sa7", "controversiality": 1, "user_reports": [], "approved_by": null, "num_reports": null, "subreddit": "anime", "body": "**One Punch Man**\n\n* **+**Perfectly timed comedy\n* **+**Saitama gives the viewers what they want\n* **+**Plot entices viewers appetite for more\n\n* **-**Predictable\n* **-**Flat characters\n* **-**Overall plot has little substance\n\n**Mob Psycho 100**\n\n* **+**Characterization is on point\n* **+**Half-decent plot\n* **+**MC is realistic\n\n* **-**Weak MC(*Anti-violence*)\n* **-**Somewhat predictable\n* **-**Doesn't fully utilize MC fight-winning satisification", "id": "d894sa7", "report_reasons": null, "author_flair_text": null, "removal_reason": null, "parent_id": "t3_55ba80", "edited": false, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "stickied": false}, {"body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the non-violence aspect of it.

I can't believe how many people I've seen actually say they're considering voting for Trump just to stick it to SJW's or open the door for a more progressive alternative than Hillary in four years... it's just mind-boggling. I don't truly believe it but part of people wonders if people actually kind of need to see what a Trump presidency would *actually* look like to have a wake-up call that this is a very very very important position and the reason it hasn't gone so far south is because we've never had anybody even close to as unprepared as Trump in it.

As a character, Neptune is a jokester-optimist and slacker who only gets serious when it&amp;#39;s really important, but when she does, she gets shit done. Saving Arfiore was something she alone decided was possible, and everyone else fled, hence it was fitting to have a duel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Nepgear is the sole main protagonist. The story is about Nepgear&amp;#39;s growth from a nerve-wracked unsure girl to a proper hero. Because this is Nepgear&amp;#39;s story, her facing down the source of her fears and winning makes for a fitting conclusion. (At least I think it&amp;#39;s like that, I haven&amp;#39;t actually gotten the true ending of Mk2 v_v;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VII) Neptune, Nepgear and Uzuzume are tri-tagonists. But, Uzume has a reason to duel the final boss because &lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"it&amp;#39;s her. If anything the battle could be viewed as a metaphor for her inner conflicts. Coming to terms with, getting in control of, and ultimately accepting the worse parts of herself.\"&gt;VII&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;V) Neptune and Plutia are dual-tagonists (In my opinion anyway. There&amp;#39;s no denying Neptune&amp;#39;s role as a main protag though). Plutia has no reason to duel Rei in this one. It&amp;#39;s not really her personality to get serious, and the final boss Rei isn&amp;#39;t even the one threatening her dimension. Maybe there&amp;#39;s some argument for Neptune having a duel with Rei, but it kinda detracts from the idea of having dual-tagonists, and steals the limelight away from the new character.

As a character, Neptune is a jokester-optimist and slacker who only gets serious when it's really important, but when she does, she gets shit done. Saving Arfiore was something she alone decided was possible, and everyone else fled, hence it was fitting to have a duel.\n\n2) Nepgear is the sole main protagonist. The story is about Nepgear's growth from a nerve-wracked unsure girl to a proper hero. Because this is Nepgear's story, her facing down the source of her fears and winning makes for a fitting conclusion. (At least I think it's like that, I haven't actually gotten the true ending of Mk2 v_v;)\n\nVII) Neptune, Nepgear and Uzuzume are tri-tagonists. But, Uzume has a reason to duel the final boss because [VII](/s \"it's her. If anything the battle could be viewed as a metaphor for her inner conflicts. Coming to terms with, getting in control of, and ultimately accepting the worse parts of herself.\") \n\nV) Neptune and Plutia are dual-tagonists (In my opinion anyway. There's no denying Neptune's role as a main protag though). Plutia has no reason to duel Rei in this one. It's not really her personality to get serious, and the final boss Rei isn't even the one threatening her dimension. Maybe there's some argument for Neptune having a duel with Rei, but it kinda detracts from the idea of having dual-tagonists, and steals the limelight away from the new character. It's also time in which you might be using the CPU candidates or Peashy who have been unavailable for most of the game, if you want to do that. \n\nHopefully that made things a little clearer. ^(sorry for txt wall v.v)", "id": "d898no4", "report_reasons": null, "author_flair_text": "Justice is subjective", "removal_reason": null, "parent_id": "t3_55baws", "edited": 1475296236.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "stickied": false}, {"body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the YuruYuri Illustration book &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/rt8SVgd.jpg\"&gt;this is my favourite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"I like to imagine I took that photo\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_55at1d", "score_hidden": false, "ups": 3, "gilded": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "created": 1475324718.0, "archived": false, "likes": null, "banned_by": null, "saved": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_32aef", "downs": 0, "author": "2matolove", "created_utc": 1475295918.0, "score": 3, "name": "t1_d898o4i", "controversiality": 0, "chain": [], "user_reports": [], "approved_by": null, "num_reports": null, "subreddit": "waifuism", "body": "Out of the YuruYuri Illustration book [this is my favourite](http://i.imgur.com/rt8SVgd.jpg)\n\n[](/s \"I like to imagine I took that photo\")", "id": "d898o4i", "report_reasons": null, "author_flair_text": null, "removal_reason": null, "parent_id": "t3_55at1d", "edited": false, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "stickied": false}, {"body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not really, I like and appreciate competition, and I actually do not like AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the other ISP, Sabernet, was charging me $25 for 1.5Mb/s service, (which isn&amp;#39;t even enough bandwidth to stream 720p video), and then they jacked up the price to $35, without increasing the speed, so I hope AT&amp;amp;T crushes them.

My Idaho school didn't have any computer science nor electronics classes (only Keyboarding), nor any resources for related after school electives. For example, they had nothing for audio/visual, and the Photography class only taught ***analog*** photography. Chemistry and biology were half-assed jokes. They skimmed over anatomy so fast you'd miss it if you blinked. They didn't offer any psychology nor sociology courses, and their history and government courses basically covered how to watch Fox News, ignore facts and still pass standardized tests. ...and I was only in the honors and AP classes.
