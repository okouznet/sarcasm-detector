There tends to be a natural upper limit for how fast a piston can be moving, and at the same rpm an engine with a longer stroke will have its pistons moving at a greater average speed to complete each cycle. The interesting thing is that the maximum MPS (mean piston speed) of the highest revving NA engines of various sizes all tend to be close to 25 meters per second. That's why high revving engines go with a larger bore:stroke ratio, so they can maintain a desirable cylinder displacement while still having a stratospheric redline. Of course, a short stroke engine with a mean piston speed of 25 m/s at 15,000 rpm would have to accelerate and change directions over a much shorter distance and time than a long stroke one at 7000 rpm, so the G's would be much higher.

The interesting thing is that the maximum MPS (mean piston speed) of the highest revving NA engines of various sizes all tend to be close to 25 meters per second. That&amp;#39;s why high revving engines go with a larger bore:stroke ratio, so they can maintain a desirable cylinder displacement while still having a stratospheric redline. Of course, a short stroke engine with a mean piston speed of 25 m/s at 15,000 rpm would have to accelerate and change directions over a much shorter distance and time than a long stroke one at 7000 rpm, so the G&amp;#39;s would be much higher.
