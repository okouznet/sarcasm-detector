So if you are twice the distance away, you get a quarter (1/2&lt;sup&gt;2)&lt;/sup&gt; of the light, and three times away you get a ninth (1/3&lt;sup&gt;3)&lt;/sup&gt; of the light&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there are some suggestions that there are some corners of Physics we don&amp;#39;t understand completely yet, and might allow a propellentless drive (see the EM drive) however, the thrust of these devices seem to be tiny tiny tiny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "parent_id": "t1_d894zy0", "archived": false, "stickied": false, "approved_by": null, "edited": false}, {"subreddit": "anime", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "name": "t1_d896gm3", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1475291659.0, "banned_by": null, "score": 1, "chain": [{"sarcastic": "n", "subreddit": "anime", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "name": "t1_d894sa7", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1475288706.0, "banned_by": null, "score": 2, "downs": 0, "score_hidden": false, "created": 1475317506.0, "saved": false, "ups": 2, "id": "d894sa7", "num_reports": null, "gilded": 0, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "edited": false, "body": "**One Punch Man**\n\n* **+**Perfectly timed comedy\n* **+**Saitama gives the viewers what they want\n* **+**Plot entices viewers appetite for more\n\n* **-**Predictable\n* **-**Flat characters\n* **-**Overall plot has little substance\n\n**Mob Psycho 100**\n\n* **+**Characterization is on point\n* **+**Half-decent plot\n* **+**MC is realistic\n\n* **-**Weak MC(*Anti-violence*)\n* **-**Somewhat predictable\n* **-**Doesn't fully utilize MC fight-winning satisification", "report_reasons": null, "author": "Rawliez", "controversiality": 1, "link_id": "t3_55ba80", "likes": null, "distinguished": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Punch Man&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;Perfectly timed comedy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;Saitama gives the viewers what they want&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;Plot entices viewers appetite for more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;Predictable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;Flat characters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;Overall plot has little substance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mob Psycho 100&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;Characterization is on point&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;Half-decent plot&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+&lt;/strong&gt;MC is realistic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;Weak MC(&lt;em&gt;Anti-violence&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;Somewhat predictable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-&lt;/strong&gt;Doesn&amp;#39;t fully utilize MC fight-winning satisification&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "author_flair_css_class": null, "archived": false, "stickied": false, "approved_by": null, "parent_id": "t3_55ba80"}, {"sarcastic": "n", "subreddit": "anime", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "name": "t1_d895m9q", "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1475290137.0, "banned_by": null, "score": 3, "downs": 0, "score_hidden": false, "created": 1475318937.0, "saved": false, "ups": 3, "id": "d895m9q", "num_reports": null, "gilded": 0, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "edited": false, "body": "I like the non-violence aspect of it.

No longer homes in on cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased damage from 35 to 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channeling the halikar in flight activates the jet-powered part of it, increasing flight speed and damage by 100% at the cost of 10 energy, modified by channeling efficiency mods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kestrel:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;increased attack speed to 1.3, base flight speed to 30 m/s and damage to 40. increased ragdolling capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;channeling the kestrel in-flight causes it to bounce indefinitely and gain weak enemy homing until it hits five enemies(modified by power throw, not sure how it&amp;#39;d work exactly) or is channeled again mid-flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cerata:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased damage to 40. Increased crit chance to 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Channeling the Cerata in-flight, at the cost of 12 energy, turns the Cerata into a infested creature(think headcrabs) that latches on to an enemy near its trajectory and deals 5 ticks of the weapon&amp;#39;s damage over 7 seconds. While the cerata-site is feeding, the enemy is stunned.  After the cerata-site has dealt its damage or the enemy it&amp;#39;s feeding on dies, it will return and restore the thrower 50% of the damage it dealt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "parent_id": "t3_55bipy", "archived": false, "stickied": false, "approved_by": null, "edited": 1475295542.0}, {"sarcastic": "y", "subreddit": "sonic", "removal_reason": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2sm2s", "name": "t1_d898dur", "author_flair_text": "", "created_utc": 1475295349.0, "banned_by": null, "score": -1, "chain": [], "downs": 0, "score_hidden": false, "created": 1475324149.0, "saved": false, "ups": -1, "id": "d898dur", "num_reports": null, "gilded": 0, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "author_flair_css_class": "S3Thunder", "body": "Just watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjHb7y0XT-A\n\nThis will just hurt the franchise even more.

Episode 3 just kind of stood out as an even brighter star than the rest of the brilliant constellation.\n\n&gt;To me, episode 3 was my first real moment of realization that Schichika lacked humanity, and truly was a sword, not just some funny goof who was a very skilled fighter.\n\n&gt;Up until that point, the opponents had been tainted by the blades.

She uses non-violent means as a first method in an attempt to shake the resolve of Schichika, instead of immediately trying to kill him. She only resorts to fighting after she discovers the truth about Shcichika's character: he is not a human, he is a sword. By the end of it, I was almost rooting for Meisai, at the very least I wanted her to live, but Schichika did not feel the same way. She was an obstacle to be cut down, regardless of morality.\")\n\n&gt;For me atleast, this episode set the precedent for the beautiful character development throughout the series by allowing us to look back and see how far Schichika had come.

My understanding of your question - and hence what I'll answer is 'What exactly is Holocaust denial, and what aspects of the Holocaust do deniers reject?\" Additionally, I'll discuss how Holocaust deniers deny the Holocaust. I'll also touch on the motivations of deniers, which is inextricably linked with their methodology.\n\n----\n\n**What exactly is Holocaust denial?**\n\nHolocaust denial's best, simple definition is \"the activity of denying the occurrence of key events and processes which constitute the Holocaust.\"1 Since deniers have no unified set of beliefs, exactly which aspect/s of the Holocaust they deny can vary greatly. Almost invariably, their claims boil down to a conclusion stating that the established number of individuals killed by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust - either six or eleven million, depending on whether non-Jewish victims of German mass-murders are included in the total - is false, and that the 'true' number of victims is considerably lower than the above totals.\n\nA Holocaust denier might claim, for instance, that a total of one million Jews were killed (though they will usually also claim they merely 'died' rather than being deliberately murdered), as opposed to the established total of ~six million. Holocaust deniers will often also deny the methodology of the Holocaust. They will often claim that Nazi Germany's 'Final Solution' aimed only to deport Jews from the Reich (as opposed to their mass murder), and may deny any or all of the following: state-organised mass murder of Jews and other minorities; the death camp system; gas chambers in the death camps; and the existence or actions of the SS Einsatzgruppen. The exact nature of what is being denied often varies, but the theme remains clear: Holocaust deniers deny one or more aspects of the Holocaust, and purport that the number of Jews and other minorities murdered in the Holocaust is subsequently lower than the historically established figures.\n\n-----------\n\n**What is the methodology of Holocaust Deniers?**\n\nHolocaust deniers deny the Holocaust in the face of a truly extraordinary mountain of evidence. The factual accuracy of the Holocaust is completely irrefutable, and no rational, informed individual would ever dispute its existence or its methodology. Few, if any, events in history are as well recorded, studied, examined and re-examined as the Holocaust. While there remains, of course, a huge amount to be learned about the minutiae of the Holocaust, its scale and functionality are so thoroughly documented by untold millions of photographs, eyewitness accounts, contemporary documents, film reels and items of physical evidence (for instance, collections of the wedding rings and shoes of those 'processed' through the death camp system or the gas chambers themselves) that rational, evidence-based disputes of its general methodology and progression are non-existent.\n\nHolocaust deniers hence find themselves attempting to deny established fact. They have no significant evidence to support their denial, and hence resort to a variety of methods ranging from fabricated evidence and psuedo-academic argumentation to emotional claims of far-reaching conspiracy - inevitably masterminded by Jews. They will often attempt to dismiss the vast array of evidence demonstrating the existence of the Holocaust as forgeries and lies planted by the above-mentioned conspirators to fool the public, in order to avoid engaging with said evidence. They would likely claim, for instance, that I am a paid shill. Since they aim to propagate lies in the face of insurmountable evidence, they must rely on fallacious verbal arguments, ideological dogma and the exploitation of ignorance to spread their beliefs.\n\nAn excellent example of the above is the writing of Germar Rudolph, a German chemist and Holocaust denier. Rudolph authored a paper in 1991 titled \"Report on the formation and verifiability of cyanide compounds in the Auschwitz gas chambers,\" wherein he asserted various claims against the plausibility of the gas chamber system at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. To the untrained eye, Rudolph's report appears academic, however upon examination it is false in its entirety, based on fabricated and misrepresented data, and using intentionally misleading and dishonest methodology to present falsehood as truth.5 For a detailed dissection of Rudolph's writing, please see the above footnote, which makes for fascinating - if chilling - reading.\n\n------------------\n\n\n**On the motivation of Holocaust Deniers**\n\n\nHolocaust deniers are invariably motivated by ideological beliefs. In comparison to a historian, who forms theories based on evidence, Holocaust deniers cherry pick or fabricate evidence to support their ideological beliefs. These beliefs are, invariably, based on \"hatred of Jews or a desire to rehabilitate the discredited philosophy of National Socialism.\"6 In other words, Holocaust deniers invariably deny the Holocaust due to their deep-seated ideological beliefs, rather than any kind of evidence-based reasoning. /u/CrossyNZ, in a post three years ago on this topic, laid out (with some of the most brilliant prose I've ever seen) the motivation of deniers better than I could ever hope to:\n\n&gt;*\"The Holocaust is a site of rich meaning and understanding, understandings which have be made into a narrative about what is true virtue, and what happens in the lack of it. Although awful, other genocides did not get this build up of meaning around them, and so are pushed into the public's historical background. As historians we know how some events carry more \"charge\" and meaning around them. ((For Americans, examples would be things like Pearl Harbor, the dropping of the atomic bombs, and 9/11. Events which polarize people because they see that event as a day when the world for them \"altered\".))*\n\n&gt;*\"In some ways, therefore, and forgive me, Holocaust deniers aren't attacking the historical truth of the holocaust - that would be an absurd thing to do. If it was just the historical truth of the Holocaust free from this meaning, then they wouldn't give two figs. They are seeking to reject parts of that richness of understanding built up around it that they find themselves objecting to - and they chose this ridiculous, offensive method to do it. As an historian and a human being, I cannot have more contempt for them.*\n\n&gt;*\"Trying to convince them of the obvious, blatant truth of the Holocaust is therefore a lost cause, because they are not interested in the truth. They are interested in making go away whatever crawling feeling they get when the meanings attached to the holocaust - the dangers of racism, classifications, and intolerance - call out their own value set as dangerous and potentially destructive. A \"direct attack\" on their methods - pointing out the thousands of witnesses, showing the immense amount of physical evidence (both the grounds of the camps themselves and the vast amount of paperwork created by this event) - is a waste of time, because it doesn't address the real issue; that the person so denying doesn't want it to be true. Why don't they? Maybe they are convinced by racism, just a little, in their heart of hearts. Maybe they hate Israel and equate all Jews with it. The thing is, you can't know these other reasons. If you don't know what their problem is, you can't change their mind by arguing. Therefore, I suppose, the only thing to do with Holocaust deniers is to feel contempt for their methods, ignore their attempts to engage you in a public conversation, and pity them that they could have such a conflict inside them it causes them to forsake reality.\"*\n\nHolocaust denial is the victory of hatred and dogma over empathy, reason and truth in the minds of its proponents. It is a tragic phenomenon that we encounter all too often. I hope the above explanation will help you to understand it. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to respond.\n\n\n**Sources**\n\n\n&gt;Catriona Mckinnon, \"Should we tolerate Holocaust Denial?\" Res Publica 13.1 (2007), 9.

They would likely claim, for instance, that I am a paid shill. Since they aim to propagate lies in the face of insurmountable evidence, they must rely on fallacious verbal arguments, ideological dogma and the exploitation of ignorance to spread their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An excellent example of the above is the writing of Germar Rudolph, a German chemist and Holocaust denier. Rudolph authored a paper in 1991 titled &amp;quot;Report on the formation and verifiability of cyanide compounds in the Auschwitz gas chambers,&amp;quot; wherein he asserted various claims against the plausibility of the gas chamber system at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. To the untrained eye, Rudolph&amp;#39;s report appears academic, however upon examination it is false in its entirety, based on fabricated and misrepresented data, and using intentionally misleading and dishonest methodology to present falsehood as truth.5 For a detailed dissection of Rudolph&amp;#39;s writing, please see the above footnote, which makes for fascinating - if chilling - reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the motivation of Holocaust Deniers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holocaust deniers are invariably motivated by ideological beliefs. In comparison to a historian, who forms theories based on evidence, Holocaust deniers cherry pick or fabricate evidence to support their ideological beliefs. These beliefs are, invariably, based on &amp;quot;hatred of Jews or a desire to rehabilitate the discredited philosophy of National Socialism.&amp;quot;6 In other words, Holocaust deniers invariably deny the Holocaust due to their deep-seated ideological beliefs, rather than any kind of evidence-based reasoning. &lt;a href=\"/u/CrossyNZ\"&gt;/u/CrossyNZ&lt;/a&gt;, in a post three years ago on this topic, laid out (with some of the most brilliant prose I&amp;#39;ve ever seen) the motivation of deniers better than I could ever hope to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The Holocaust is a site of rich meaning and understanding, understandings which have be made into a narrative about what is true virtue, and what happens in the lack of it. Although awful, other genocides did not get this build up of meaning around them, and so are pushed into the public&amp;#39;s historical background. As historians we know how some events carry more &amp;quot;charge&amp;quot; and meaning around them. ((For Americans, examples would be things like Pearl Harbor, the dropping of the atomic bombs, and 9/11. Events which polarize people because they see that event as a day when the world for them &amp;quot;altered&amp;quot;.))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;In some ways, therefore, and forgive me, Holocaust deniers aren&amp;#39;t attacking the historical truth of the holocaust - that would be an absurd thing to do. If it was just the historical truth of the Holocaust free from this meaning, then they wouldn&amp;#39;t give two figs. They are seeking to reject parts of that richness of understanding built up around it that they find themselves objecting to - and they chose this ridiculous, offensive method to do it. As an historian and a human being, I cannot have more contempt for them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Trying to convince them of the obvious, blatant truth of the Holocaust is therefore a lost cause, because they are not interested in the truth. They are interested in making go away whatever crawling feeling they get when the meanings attached to the holocaust - the dangers of racism, classifications, and intolerance - call out their own value set as dangerous and potentially destructive. A &amp;quot;direct attack&amp;quot; on their methods - pointing out the thousands of witnesses, showing the immense amount of physical evidence (both the grounds of the camps themselves and the vast amount of paperwork created by this event) - is a waste of time, because it doesn&amp;#39;t address the real issue; that the person so denying doesn&amp;#39;t want it to be true. Why don&amp;#39;t they? Maybe they are convinced by racism, just a little, in their heart of hearts. Maybe they hate Israel and equate all Jews with it. The thing is, you can&amp;#39;t know these other reasons. If you don&amp;#39;t know what their problem is, you can&amp;#39;t change their mind by arguing. Therefore, I suppose, the only thing to do with Holocaust deniers is to feel contempt for their methods, ignore their attempts to engage you in a public conversation, and pity them that they could have such a conflict inside them it causes them to forsake reality.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holocaust denial is the victory of hatred and dogma over empathy, reason and truth in the minds of its proponents. It is a tragic phenomenon that we encounter all too often. I hope the above explanation will help you to understand it. If you have any questions, please don&amp;#39;t hesitate to respond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Catriona Mckinnon, &amp;quot;Should we tolerate Holocaust Denial?&amp;quot; Res Publica 13.1 (2007), 9.

I personally think you have the characters mischaracterised, and I don&amp;#39;t like your other gripes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main thing is the characters. Senjougahara (the main girl) starts off being a typical &amp;#39;violent tsundere&amp;#39;. This is because she&amp;#39;s trying to push everyone away from her so they don&amp;#39;t find out about her low weight because of the Weight Crab. As the series progresses, her insults to Araragi become affectionate to the point that they aren&amp;#39;t nearly as common nor abrasive, and she stops being physically violent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hachikuji (the lost, little girl) I don&amp;#39;t have as strong a case against your interpretation, but I do think she is a nice character and is more of a character for Araragi to interact with and play off, really. I don&amp;#39;t like the groping bits either, they were one of my major gripes with the show, but again they aren&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; prevalant later on and Hachikuji even points out to Araragi that she doesn&amp;#39;t mind and it&amp;#39;s really just a performance/play between them (when he tells her he&amp;#39;s seen the error of his ways). Again, I know this doesn&amp;#39;t justify it but it&amp;#39;s something I can overlook given it&amp;#39;s not completely non-conformant with Araragi&amp;#39;s characterisation, isn&amp;#39;t too prevalant, and is justified between the characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nadeko (the &amp;quot;I have feelings for onii-chan&amp;quot; girl) is meant to be generic, this is actually quite an important part of her character and it gets developed on in her next arc. I personally like her design, though!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding Hanekawa (&amp;quot;big-boobed cat girl&amp;quot;), it&amp;#39;s important to remember that we view the series through the narrator, Araragi,&amp;#39;s eyes, which is why there&amp;#39;s a small focus on Hanekawa being &amp;quot;the ideal woman&amp;quot;, aesthetically, because that is what she is to Araragi. She&amp;#39;s the ideal he feels he could never be good enough for, and ultimately stopped pursuing because of that. This is also quite interesting as a part of Hanekawa&amp;#39;s development is about how she feels like she has to hold herself up to ridiculous standards, yet feels she is actually very selfish. She hates that people think she&amp;#39;s perfect, and she liked Araragi at first because he treated her rather normally, though eventually he came to see her as the perfect woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like the fanservice either, but I went into that with it being from Araragi&amp;#39;s viewpoint. I think a lot of the fanservice is questionable and I would rather be without, but there&amp;#39;s also a lot that isn&amp;#39;t so bad. The panty shot scene you&amp;#39;re referring to is from the very start of the series (Kizumonogatari) and is when Araragi, at that time a loner who pretends &amp;quot;having friends will lower [his] intensity as a human&amp;quot;, meets Hanekawa who, against his protests, becomes his friend. So I think the fanservice in that scene was meant to be a parody of similar scenes in other material, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The story isn&amp;#39;t really meant to be interesting in the way I think you mean. Monogatari is a character driven show at heart. It has some enjoyable action at times (see Suruga Monkey fight, Nisemonogatari final fight and fight with Karen) but if character driven plotlines and interactions don&amp;#39;t appeal to you, the show just probably isn&amp;#39;t for you.

Besides the fact that it&amp;#39;s not necessary to view the still frames (which have sentences from the point of view of characters to (briefly) show what&amp;#39;s going on their heads, not &amp;quot;deep quotes&amp;quot;), I never really found it annoying.

I really like Renai Circulation, and it has a nice companion in Mousou Express which is the OP for the second Nadeko arc; I&amp;#39;d suggest listening to it if you liked Renai Circulation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "banned_by": null, "num_reports": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "id": "d88wij5", "author_flair_css_class": "MAL", "link_id": "t3_557cok", "body": "Of course, you're perfectly entitled to your own opinion on Bakemonogatari, especially with a show as polarising as the Monogatari series, but I'd like to share/argue what I like about the show. I personally think you have the characters mischaracterised, and I don't like your other gripes.\n\nThe main thing is the characters. Senjougahara (the main girl) starts off being a typical 'violent tsundere'. This is because she's trying to push everyone away from her so they don't find out about her low weight because of the Weight Crab. As the series progresses, her insults to Araragi become affectionate to the point that they aren't nearly as common nor abrasive, and she stops being physically violent.\n\nHachikuji (the lost, little girl) I don't have as strong a case against your interpretation, but I do think she is a nice character and is more of a character for Araragi to interact with and play off, really. I don't like the groping bits either, they were one of my major gripes with the show, but again they aren't *as* prevalant later on and Hachikuji even points out to Araragi that she doesn't mind and it's really just a performance/play between them (when he tells her he's seen the error of his ways). Again, I know this doesn't justify it but it's something I can overlook given it's not completely non-conformant with Araragi's characterisation, isn't too prevalant, and is justified between the characters.\n\nNadeko (the \"I have feelings for onii-chan\" girl) is meant to be generic, this is actually quite an important part of her character and it gets developed on in her next arc. I personally like her design, though!\n\nRegarding Hanekawa (\"big-boobed cat girl\"), it's important to remember that we view the series through the narrator, Araragi,'s eyes, which is why there's a small focus on Hanekawa being \"the ideal woman\", aesthetically, because that is what she is to Araragi. She's the ideal he feels he could never be good enough for, and ultimately stopped pursuing because of that. This is also quite interesting as a part of Hanekawa's development is about how she feels like she has to hold herself up to ridiculous standards, yet feels she is actually very selfish. She hates that people think she's perfect, and she liked Araragi at first because he treated her rather normally, though eventually he came to see her as the perfect woman.\n\nI don't like the fanservice either, but I went into that with it being from Araragi's viewpoint. I think a lot of the fanservice is questionable and I would rather be without, but there's also a lot that isn't so bad. The panty shot scene you're referring to is from the very start of the series (Kizumonogatari) and is when Araragi, at that time a loner who pretends \"having friends will lower [his] intensity as a human\", meets Hanekawa who, against his protests, becomes his friend. So I think the fanservice in that scene was meant to be a parody of similar scenes in other material, maybe?\n\nThe story isn't really meant to be interesting in the way I think you mean. Monogatari is a character driven show at heart. It has some enjoyable action at times (see Suruga Monkey fight, Nisemonogatari final fight and fight with Karen) but if character driven plotlines and interactions don't appeal to you, the show just probably isn't for you. I also think that's the case if you don't like the \"slides\"/artsy presentation of it. Besides the fact that it's not necessary to view the still frames (which have sentences from the point of view of characters to (briefly) show what's going on their heads, not \"deep quotes\"), I never really found it annoying. At least if you do, it's much less prevalant as the series goes on, since in Bakemonogatari a lot of the artsy direction is due to having a low budget, I believe.\n\nAt least we can certainly agree on the music, haha.

It is very helpful to partition the hull into smaller segments so that a single hull breach will flood the ship. In 16littlejay&amp;#39;s design the hull of the ship is 3 metal blocks thick, but there are spaces in between the armor which have air pumps in them. This allows for a heavily armored, yet buoyant ship. Using wood for internal areas where armor is not a necessity will help to increase buoyancy as well. When moving through the water hydrofoils can be employed to lift the ship higher and increase the top speed.  Really my only critique of his design is that it could be slight wider. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is actually a good thing of the ships rides low in the water because water offers your ship great protection. I try to keep my deck about 3-4m above the water line if that. If you are still having trouble with bouncy perhaps you are using too much armor?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as advanced cannons, I like to have one turret that shoots smaller faster projectiles capable of penetrating through an entire ship assuming no shields. This can be done with a slightly smaller gauge than used with explosive shells while still using 1-3m clips. This will allow for enough gunpowder casing to get a fast shell velocity. I like to use a sabot head and body, and a normal body.  These cannons will shred non-shielded enemies as they will seemingly ignore armor and punch right through to ammo storage and AI.  To get a faster fire rate use a shit load of belt fed autoloaders and coolers, more barrels and recoil absorbers are important as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For explosive advanced cannons, I prefer a gauge of 250-500mm and 2-3m long clips. I like to keep these shells at lower speeds (around 200-400) m/s so they have a greater chance of penetrating shields. I like to use a shaped charge head and 1-2 HE bodies depending on the size of a shell. I usually end the shell with the a piece that explodes after a certain level of armor penetration or angular deflection (I forget what they are called).  Also check out the graviton ram attachment it could be very useful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the two. most important parts of building an advanced cannon is making efficient use of space (look at some designs of turrets on ships of steam workshop for this). And secondly, armoring your turrets well both above as bellow deck. The work thing that can happen is your turrets exploding below deck and causing a chain reaction bc internal armor is too weak. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as engines go, basically injectors are the best way to add power, but at a cost to efficiency, and always have exhaust going outside the vehicle.

(~30ms)\n\n\n**2degrees**\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Excellent service and support\n* Excellent speeds &amp; international routing\n* Modem provided (FritzBox! 7490)\n* VERY knowledgeable staff, even on their FB Page. \n* Dynamic IP by default, no CGNAT\n* IPv6 Support\n* Traffic managed in Christchurch, low latency to Dunedin services (~10ms)\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Mostly contract based\n* Monthly Static IP Fee (+$10)\n* Phone support lines are often saturated\n\nIt's been a few months since we left BigPipe so a few things might have changed since then. We only left due to being a frequent target of DDoS attacks (Absolutely not their fault), had an impact on other BigPipe customers too, which isn't fair on anyone. \n\nTransferring files between home and Polytech has been absolutely amazing with 2degrees, easily getting ~50MB/s over FTP. \n\nLet me know if you have any further questions, I'm sure /u/BigPipeNZ will be able to tell you more about their excellent service.
