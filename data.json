My understanding of your question - and hence what I'll answer is 'What exactly is Holocaust denial, and what aspects of the Holocaust do deniers reject?\" Additionally, I'll discuss how Holocaust deniers deny the Holocaust. I'll also touch on the motivations of deniers, which is inextricably linked with their methodology.\n\n----\n\n**What exactly is Holocaust denial?**\n\nHolocaust denial's best, simple definition is \"the activity of denying the occurrence of key events and processes which constitute the Holocaust.\"1 Since deniers have no unified set of beliefs, exactly which aspect/s of the Holocaust they deny can vary greatly. Almost invariably, their claims boil down to a conclusion stating that the established number of individuals killed by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust - either six or eleven million, depending on whether non-Jewish victims of German mass-murders are included in the total - is false, and that the 'true' number of victims is considerably lower than the above totals.\n\nA Holocaust denier might claim, for instance, that a total of one million Jews were killed (though they will usually also claim they merely 'died' rather than being deliberately murdered), as opposed to the established total of ~six million. Holocaust deniers will often also deny the methodology of the Holocaust. They will often claim that Nazi Germany's 'Final Solution' aimed only to deport Jews from the Reich (as opposed to their mass murder), and may deny any or all of the following: state-organised mass murder of Jews and other minorities; the death camp system; gas chambers in the death camps; and the existence or actions of the SS Einsatzgruppen. The exact nature of what is being denied often varies, but the theme remains clear: Holocaust deniers deny one or more aspects of the Holocaust, and purport that the number of Jews and other minorities murdered in the Holocaust is subsequently lower than the historically established figures.\n\n-----------\n\n**What is the methodology of Holocaust Deniers?**\n\nHolocaust deniers deny the Holocaust in the face of a truly extraordinary mountain of evidence. The factual accuracy of the Holocaust is completely irrefutable, and no rational, informed individual would ever dispute its existence or its methodology. Few, if any, events in history are as well recorded, studied, examined and re-examined as the Holocaust. While there remains, of course, a huge amount to be learned about the minutiae of the Holocaust, its scale and functionality are so thoroughly documented by untold millions of photographs, eyewitness accounts, contemporary documents, film reels and items of physical evidence (for instance, collections of the wedding rings and shoes of those 'processed' through the death camp system or the gas chambers themselves) that rational, evidence-based disputes of its general methodology and progression are non-existent.\n\nHolocaust deniers hence find themselves attempting to deny established fact. They have no significant evidence to support their denial, and hence resort to a variety of methods ranging from fabricated evidence and psuedo-academic argumentation to emotional claims of far-reaching conspiracy - inevitably masterminded by Jews. They will often attempt to dismiss the vast array of evidence demonstrating the existence of the Holocaust as forgeries and lies planted by the above-mentioned conspirators to fool the public, in order to avoid engaging with said evidence. They would likely claim, for instance, that I am a paid shill. Since they aim to propagate lies in the face of insurmountable evidence, they must rely on fallacious verbal arguments, ideological dogma and the exploitation of ignorance to spread their beliefs.\n\nAn excellent example of the above is the writing of Germar Rudolph, a German chemist and Holocaust denier. Rudolph authored a paper in 1991 titled \"Report on the formation and verifiability of cyanide compounds in the Auschwitz gas chambers,\" wherein he asserted various claims against the plausibility of the gas chamber system at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. To the untrained eye, Rudolph's report appears academic, however upon examination it is false in its entirety, based on fabricated and misrepresented data, and using intentionally misleading and dishonest methodology to present falsehood as truth.5 For a detailed dissection of Rudolph's writing, please see the above footnote, which makes for fascinating - if chilling - reading.\n\n------------------\n\n\n**On the motivation of Holocaust Deniers**\n\n\nHolocaust deniers are invariably motivated by ideological beliefs. In comparison to a historian, who forms theories based on evidence, Holocaust deniers cherry pick or fabricate evidence to support their ideological beliefs. These beliefs are, invariably, based on \"hatred of Jews or a desire to rehabilitate the discredited philosophy of National Socialism.\"6 In other words, Holocaust deniers invariably deny the Holocaust due to their deep-seated ideological beliefs, rather than any kind of evidence-based reasoning. /u/CrossyNZ, in a post three years ago on this topic, laid out (with some of the most brilliant prose I've ever seen) the motivation of deniers better than I could ever hope to:\n\n&gt;*\"The Holocaust is a site of rich meaning and understanding, understandings which have be made into a narrative about what is true virtue, and what happens in the lack of it. Although awful, other genocides did not get this build up of meaning around them, and so are pushed into the public's historical background. As historians we know how some events carry more \"charge\" and meaning around them. ((For Americans, examples would be things like Pearl Harbor, the dropping of the atomic bombs, and 9/11. Events which polarize people because they see that event as a day when the world for them \"altered\".))*\n\n&gt;*\"In some ways, therefore, and forgive me, Holocaust deniers aren't attacking the historical truth of the holocaust - that would be an absurd thing to do. If it was just the historical truth of the Holocaust free from this meaning, then they wouldn't give two figs. They are seeking to reject parts of that richness of understanding built up around it that they find themselves objecting to - and they chose this ridiculous, offensive method to do it. As an historian and a human being, I cannot have more contempt for them.*\n\n&gt;*\"Trying to convince them of the obvious, blatant truth of the Holocaust is therefore a lost cause, because they are not interested in the truth. They are interested in making go away whatever crawling feeling they get when the meanings attached to the holocaust - the dangers of racism, classifications, and intolerance - call out their own value set as dangerous and potentially destructive. A \"direct attack\" on their methods - pointing out the thousands of witnesses, showing the immense amount of physical evidence (both the grounds of the camps themselves and the vast amount of paperwork created by this event) - is a waste of time, because it doesn't address the real issue; that the person so denying doesn't want it to be true. Why don't they? Maybe they are convinced by racism, just a little, in their heart of hearts. Maybe they hate Israel and equate all Jews with it. The thing is, you can't know these other reasons. If you don't know what their problem is, you can't change their mind by arguing. Therefore, I suppose, the only thing to do with Holocaust deniers is to feel contempt for their methods, ignore their attempts to engage you in a public conversation, and pity them that they could have such a conflict inside them it causes them to forsake reality.\"*\n\nHolocaust denial is the victory of hatred and dogma over empathy, reason and truth in the minds of its proponents. It is a tragic phenomenon that we encounter all too often. I hope the above explanation will help you to understand it. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to respond.\n\n\n**Sources**\n\n\n&gt;Catriona Mckinnon, \"Should we tolerate Holocaust Denial?\" Res Publica 13.1 (2007), 9.

I only trust some of my mates with the new Porsche.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The nail in the coffin was when eldest asked Dad: &amp;quot;I thought you said we were going to see that movie tonight?&amp;quot; To which he replies simply: &amp;quot;Oh ... yeh sorry mate, I forgot.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in that moment, I realised that these kids were being told over and over and over: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t really matter that much to me.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: About 2 months after this happened, the kids packed up and left the school with about a week&amp;#39;s notice.

And the Franco-Canadians that do exist here have co-existed for so long that they're basically indistinguishable from the rest of the Anglo-Canadian population. The way \"English and French are Canada's official languages, use it, non-assimilating non-white people!\" meme on this sub annoys me to no end because there is no actual support for French content or topics on this sub. It's really almost always utilized exclusively by Anglo-white supremacists under the guise of some mild mannered Canadian nationalism. The one time I recall someone posting on this sub asking if there were any Francophones around it was downvoted to hell and the comments were \"je veu du fromage\" type stuff. Please, stop using French as some weird tool to push your agenda against \"foreign\" languages when aside from that, you never cared about French issues to begin with. The reason why French signage exists in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick isn't because of some abstract Canadian nationalist sentiment, it's because there is a population that would do better because of it. The equivalents here in BC are Chinese and Punjabi because those are the most used languages after English. They are living breathing languages being used on a daily basis. If it weren't for the perceived threat of new cultures and peoples co-existing in the same space as previously Anglo-dominated regions, nobody in BC would even give two hoots about French, and that was just the way it was before all this Richmond Chinese Sign Ghetto nonsense was spread around on the internet. \n\nRedditors on r/Vancouver are also dancing around the bear in the room - that even from a historical standpoint the Chinese and Pacific Asian countries have had a far greater influence here in both a human, political, and economic capacity that was only curtailed by artificial limitations placed on them like the Chinese Head Tax or outright exclusion. The only reason French is even taught in K-12 here is because the government forces it. From a practical perspective, teaching any of the Asian languages would both be much more useful given Asia's proximity to the west coast and easier to learn given that their are large populations of native speakers for most of the major languages.

Vancouver has the criteria to become a truly global mega-city in the future which dwarfs Seattle, but people are too fucked in the head to realize it because they're too proud to give up their version of \"Canadian\" culture.

How about, instead of trying to eliminate foreign influences to save a non-existent quasi Anglo-French identity, maybe British Columbians should realize it never existed here in the first place. Let's be honest, people in BC can't understand any French to save our lives. I went through French education for 12 years and I can't even remember a thing of what I was taught, because there is truly nobody to talk in French with. But there is a LARGE Chinese population just south of Vancouver you know, so why not like, take advantage of it? Why does every single fucking thing have to be a negative? How about the next time you see a Chinese language sign, be like, oh shit I know what that means, maybe I should translate it, go into the store, and ask if maybe the owner would like you to know what it means in English? Maybe the next time you see a Chinese only menu, you could offer to translate it and show them that there are actually non-Chinese people who'll use their services, so they'll be incentivized to include English as well?

And the Franco-Canadians that do exist here have co-existed for so long that they&amp;#39;re basically indistinguishable from the rest of the Anglo-Canadian population. The way &amp;quot;English and French are Canada&amp;#39;s official languages, use it, non-assimilating non-white people!&amp;quot; meme on this sub annoys me to no end because there is no actual support for French content or topics on this sub. It&amp;#39;s really almost always utilized exclusively by Anglo-white supremacists under the guise of some mild mannered Canadian nationalism. The one time I recall someone posting on this sub asking if there were any Francophones around it was downvoted to hell and the comments were &amp;quot;je veu du fromage&amp;quot; type stuff. Please, stop using French as some weird tool to push your agenda against &amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot; languages when aside from that, you never cared about French issues to begin with. The reason why French signage exists in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick isn&amp;#39;t because of some abstract Canadian nationalist sentiment, it&amp;#39;s because there is a population that would do better because of it. The equivalents here in BC are Chinese and Punjabi because those are the most used languages after English. They are living breathing languages being used on a daily basis. If it weren&amp;#39;t for the perceived threat of new cultures and peoples co-existing in the same space as previously Anglo-dominated regions, nobody in BC would even give two hoots about French, and that was just the way it was before all this Richmond Chinese Sign Ghetto nonsense was spread around on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Redditors on &lt;a href=\"/r/Vancouver\"&gt;r/Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; are also dancing around the bear in the room - that even from a historical standpoint the Chinese and Pacific Asian countries have had a far greater influence here in both a human, political, and economic capacity that was only curtailed by artificial limitations placed on them like the Chinese Head Tax or outright exclusion. The only reason French is even taught in K-12 here is because the government forces it.

As a character, Neptune is a jokester-optimist and slacker who only gets serious when it's really important, but when she does, she gets shit done. Saving Arfiore was something she alone decided was possible, and everyone else fled, hence it was fitting to have a duel.\n\n2) Nepgear is the sole main protagonist. The story is about Nepgear's growth from a nerve-wracked unsure girl to a proper hero. Because this is Nepgear's story, her facing down the source of her fears and winning makes for a fitting conclusion. (At least I think it's like that, I haven't actually gotten the true ending of Mk2 v_v;)\n\nVII) Neptune, Nepgear and Uzuzume are tri-tagonists. But, Uzume has a reason to duel the final boss because [VII](/s \"it's her. If anything the battle could be viewed as a metaphor for her inner conflicts. Coming to terms with, getting in control of, and ultimately accepting the worse parts of herself.\") \n\nV) Neptune and Plutia are dual-tagonists (In my opinion anyway. There's no denying Neptune's role as a main protag though). Plutia has no reason to duel Rei in this one. It's not really her personality to get serious, and the final boss Rei isn't even the one threatening her dimension. Maybe there's some argument for Neptune having a duel with Rei, but it kinda detracts from the idea of having dual-tagonists, and steals the limelight away from the new character. It's also time in which you might be using the CPU candidates or Peashy who have been unavailable for most of the game, if you want to do that. \n\nHopefully that made things a little clearer. ^(sorry for txt wall v.v)", "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1475324692.0, "approved_by": null, "created_utc": 1475295892.0, "user_reports": [], "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Disclaimer: I&amp;#39;ve only played Rebirth 1/2/3 and V2, not the originals, so there may be some differences/discrepancies I&amp;#39;m missing if you&amp;#39;re referring to the originals.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, there was just no reason for it to be there, in the other games there were story mechanic or character reasons for a 1-on-1 duel.

Because this is Nepgear&amp;#39;s story, her facing down the source of her fears and winning makes for a fitting conclusion. (At least I think it&amp;#39;s like that, I haven&amp;#39;t actually gotten the true ending of Mk2 v_v;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VII) Neptune, Nepgear and Uzuzume are tri-tagonists. But, Uzume has a reason to duel the final boss because &lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"it&amp;#39;s her. If anything the battle could be viewed as a metaphor for her inner conflicts. Coming to terms with, getting in control of, and ultimately accepting the worse parts of herself.\"&gt;VII&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;V) Neptune and Plutia are dual-tagonists (In my opinion anyway. There&amp;#39;s no denying Neptune&amp;#39;s role as a main protag though). Plutia has no reason to duel Rei in this one. It&amp;#39;s not really her personality to get serious, and the final boss Rei isn&amp;#39;t even the one threatening her dimension. Maybe there&amp;#39;s some argument for Neptune having a duel with Rei, but it kinda detracts from the idea of having dual-tagonists, and steals the limelight away from the new character. It&amp;#39;s also time in which you might be using the CPU candidates or Peashy who have been unavailable for most of the game, if you want to do that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that made things a little clearer. &lt;sup&gt;sorry for txt wall v.v&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "author_flair_css_class": "bsha", "likes": null, "score": 3, "mod_reports": []}, {"saved": false, "id": "d898o4i", "ups": 3, "link_id": "t3_55at1d", "subreddit_id": "t5_32aef", "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "waifuism", "author": "2matolove", "parent_id": "t3_55at1d", "score_hidden": false, "chain": [], "banned_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "name": "t1_d898o4i", "edited": false, "removal_reason": null, "body": "Out of the YuruYuri Illustration book [this is my favourite](http://i.imgur.com/rt8SVgd.jpg)\n\n[](/s \"I like to imagine I took that photo\")", "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1475324718.0, "approved_by": null, "created_utc": 1475295918.0, "user_reports": [], "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the YuruYuri Illustration book &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/rt8SVgd.jpg\"&gt;this is my favourite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"I like to imagine I took that photo\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "author_flair_css_class": null, "likes": null, "score": 3, "mod_reports": []}, {"saved": false, "id": "d898otz", "ups": -2, "link_id": "t3_559tt8", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "technology", "author": "skidmark-steve", "parent_id": "t1_d894d4q", "score_hidden": false, "chain": [{"saved": false, "id": "d88wa0h", "ups": 337, "link_id": "t3_559tt8", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh16", "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "technology", "author": "CellSalesThrowaway2", "parent_id": "t3_559tt8", "score_hidden": false, "banned_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "name": "t1_d88wa0h", "edited": false, "removal_reason": null, "body": "Folks, please keep in mind that this article is taking about wired home Internet not AT&amp;T wireless.

I personally think you have the characters mischaracterised, and I don't like your other gripes.\n\nThe main thing is the characters. Senjougahara (the main girl) starts off being a typical 'violent tsundere'. This is because she's trying to push everyone away from her so they don't find out about her low weight because of the Weight Crab. As the series progresses, her insults to Araragi become affectionate to the point that they aren't nearly as common nor abrasive, and she stops being physically violent.\n\nHachikuji (the lost, little girl) I don't have as strong a case against your interpretation, but I do think she is a nice character and is more of a character for Araragi to interact with and play off, really. I don't like the groping bits either, they were one of my major gripes with the show, but again they aren't *as* prevalant later on and Hachikuji even points out to Araragi that she doesn't mind and it's really just a performance/play between them (when he tells her he's seen the error of his ways). Again, I know this doesn't justify it but it's something I can overlook given it's not completely non-conformant with Araragi's characterisation, isn't too prevalant, and is justified between the characters.\n\nNadeko (the \"I have feelings for onii-chan\" girl) is meant to be generic, this is actually quite an important part of her character and it gets developed on in her next arc. I personally like her design, though!\n\nRegarding Hanekawa (\"big-boobed cat girl\"), it's important to remember that we view the series through the narrator, Araragi,'s eyes, which is why there's a small focus on Hanekawa being \"the ideal woman\", aesthetically, because that is what she is to Araragi. She's the ideal he feels he could never be good enough for, and ultimately stopped pursuing because of that. This is also quite interesting as a part of Hanekawa's development is about how she feels like she has to hold herself up to ridiculous standards, yet feels she is actually very selfish. She hates that people think she's perfect, and she liked Araragi at first because he treated her rather normally, though eventually he came to see her as the perfect woman.\n\nI don't like the fanservice either, but I went into that with it being from Araragi's viewpoint. I think a lot of the fanservice is questionable and I would rather be without, but there's also a lot that isn't so bad. The panty shot scene you're referring to is from the very start of the series (Kizumonogatari) and is when Araragi, at that time a loner who pretends \"having friends will lower [his] intensity as a human\", meets Hanekawa who, against his protests, becomes his friend. So I think the fanservice in that scene was meant to be a parody of similar scenes in other material, maybe?\n\nThe story isn't really meant to be interesting in the way I think you mean. Monogatari is a character driven show at heart. It has some enjoyable action at times (see Suruga Monkey fight, Nisemonogatari final fight and fight with Karen) but if character driven plotlines and interactions don't appeal to you, the show just probably isn't for you. I also think that's the case if you don't like the \"slides\"/artsy presentation of it. Besides the fact that it's not necessary to view the still frames (which have sentences from the point of view of characters to (briefly) show what's going on their heads, not \"deep quotes\"), I never really found it annoying. At least if you do, it's much less prevalant as the series goes on, since in Bakemonogatari a lot of the artsy direction is due to having a low budget, I believe.\n\nAt least we can certainly agree on the music, haha.

As the series progresses, her insults to Araragi become affectionate to the point that they aren&amp;#39;t nearly as common nor abrasive, and she stops being physically violent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hachikuji (the lost, little girl) I don&amp;#39;t have as strong a case against your interpretation, but I do think she is a nice character and is more of a character for Araragi to interact with and play off, really. I don&amp;#39;t like the groping bits either, they were one of my major gripes with the show, but again they aren&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; prevalant later on and Hachikuji even points out to Araragi that she doesn&amp;#39;t mind and it&amp;#39;s really just a performance/play between them (when he tells her he&amp;#39;s seen the error of his ways). Again, I know this doesn&amp;#39;t justify it but it&amp;#39;s something I can overlook given it&amp;#39;s not completely non-conformant with Araragi&amp;#39;s characterisation, isn&amp;#39;t too prevalant, and is justified between the characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nadeko (the &amp;quot;I have feelings for onii-chan&amp;quot; girl) is meant to be generic, this is actually quite an important part of her character and it gets developed on in her next arc. I personally like her design, though!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding Hanekawa (&amp;quot;big-boobed cat girl&amp;quot;), it&amp;#39;s important to remember that we view the series through the narrator, Araragi,&amp;#39;s eyes, which is why there&amp;#39;s a small focus on Hanekawa being &amp;quot;the ideal woman&amp;quot;, aesthetically, because that is what she is to Araragi. She&amp;#39;s the ideal he feels he could never be good enough for, and ultimately stopped pursuing because of that. This is also quite interesting as a part of Hanekawa&amp;#39;s development is about how she feels like she has to hold herself up to ridiculous standards, yet feels she is actually very selfish. She hates that people think she&amp;#39;s perfect, and she liked Araragi at first because he treated her rather normally, though eventually he came to see her as the perfect woman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like the fanservice either, but I went into that with it being from Araragi&amp;#39;s viewpoint. I think a lot of the fanservice is questionable and I would rather be without, but there&amp;#39;s also a lot that isn&amp;#39;t so bad. The panty shot scene you&amp;#39;re referring to is from the very start of the series (Kizumonogatari) and is when Araragi, at that time a loner who pretends &amp;quot;having friends will lower [his] intensity as a human&amp;quot;, meets Hanekawa who, against his protests, becomes his friend. So I think the fanservice in that scene was meant to be a parody of similar scenes in other material, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The story isn&amp;#39;t really meant to be interesting in the way I think you mean. Monogatari is a character driven show at heart. It has some enjoyable action at times (see Suruga Monkey fight, Nisemonogatari final fight and fight with Karen) but if character driven plotlines and interactions don&amp;#39;t appeal to you, the show just probably isn&amp;#39;t for you. I also think that&amp;#39;s the case if you don&amp;#39;t like the &amp;quot;slides&amp;quot;/artsy presentation of it. Besides the fact that it&amp;#39;s not necessary to view the still frames (which have sentences from the point of view of characters to (briefly) show what&amp;#39;s going on their heads, not &amp;quot;deep quotes&amp;quot;), I never really found it annoying. At least if you do, it&amp;#39;s much less prevalant as the series goes on, since in Bakemonogatari a lot of the artsy direction is due to having a low budget, I believe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At least we can certainly agree on the music, haha. I really like Renai Circulation, and it has a nice companion in Mousou Express which is the OP for the second Nadeko arc; I&amp;#39;d suggest listening to it if you liked Renai Circulation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "author_flair_css_class": "MAL", "likes": null, "score": 2, "mod_reports": []}], "banned_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "name": "t1_d89bxke", "edited": 1475304343.0, "removal_reason": null, "body": "OP I felt similar to you after finishing Bake, but after finishing the series it's become my favorite franchise purely for the characters. \n\nMonogatari is all about the relationships the MC has with each character (at least before the plot gets crazy like it does later).

My point is, and we'll choose the Christian god here, that god is a magnificent benefactor full of infinite love, wisdom, compassion, etc. Going new testament here for the sake of convenience, before god's great remix in the old testament, he was kind of a dick.\n\nSo you ask people who is god, they say he's the father of all life and being, he's infinite love, compassion, etc. So you ask how they know, they say because it's in a book and everybody knows that. If you keep going with that, it boils down to \"because god said so.\" I mean, I can come up to you on the street and say that I'm an eccentric billionaire and I want to make your day by giving you $10,000,000, but you have to spend the next 20 years doing nice shit for people, respecting your neighbors, generally not being a dick, etc. If you're like me, you'll probably get a good laugh and carry on about your business.

Awesome!\" and then start immediately serving/worshipping him. It's pretty clear that the god complex in that example is a matter of circumstances, as in \"You're bigger than me, I can't figure out why, want a free statue?\" So ultimately, assuming god exists, it's kinda irresponsible to just take him/her/it/that/etc. at it's word. How about some fucking references, or some proof, or some actual good deeds to *prove* the mysterious space benefactor angle? Because as I see it, as a non-believer but still open to the idea, all we've got now is hearsay and weird diseases.\n\nThe other point, that god is dead, goes off the assumption that god at least existed at one point, but doesn't anymore. Look at the bible, there haven't been any additions to it in a *pretty* long time. All kinds of awesome shit was happening in the bible - wars between heaven and hell, divine espionage, burning bushes that said stuff, talking snakes, the heavens and earth moving on a whim, direct communication, etc. What happened between now and then? As human civilization advanced through the years, god hasn't really been in the picture, nor has satan, or any of the other fantastic shit going on back then. My argument is that if god and the gang existed, they're either dead, forgot about us, or willfully abandoned us. Look at the world around you. Science and medicine have lead to overpopulation, wars are being fought over shit people are finding in the ground and who's god can beat up who's god, kids are born with cancer, insects lay eggs in people's eyes and brains, etc. It's not exactly the thriving utopia we were promised, and god hasn't said fuck all to anyone except the clinically insane. That's also kind of a big deal.\n\nSo to summarize, I'm not trying to say \"religion is stupid and people should think otherwise,\" I'm trying to say maybe we need to analyze religion in the modern world and why god/s aren't as involved as they used to be.", "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1475336470.0, "approved_by": null, "created_utc": 1475307670.0, "user_reports": [], "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the thing about morality though - it varies personally and culturally.

That&amp;#39;s also kind of a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to summarize, I&amp;#39;m not trying to say &amp;quot;religion is stupid and people should think otherwise,&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m trying to say maybe we need to analyze religion in the modern world and why god/s aren&amp;#39;t as involved as they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "author_flair_css_class": null, "likes": null, "score": 2, "mod_reports": []}, {"saved": false, "id": "d89d2a3", "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_55ca3w", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhq", "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "investing", "author": "_Quotr", "parent_id": "t1_d89d1ue", "score_hidden": false, "chain": [{"saved": false, "id": "d89d1ue", "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_55ca3w", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhq", "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "investing", "author": "DrunkCircusBear", "parent_id": "t3_55ca3w", "score_hidden": false, "banned_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "name": "t1_d89d1ue", "edited": false, "removal_reason": null, "body": "Just swing trading $TVIX until after the election.", "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1475336464.0, "approved_by": null, "created_utc": 1475307664.0, "user_reports": [], "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just swing trading $TVIX until after the election.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "author_flair_css_class": null, "likes": null, "score": 1, "mod_reports": []}], "banned_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "name": "t1_d89d2a3", "edited": false, "removal_reason": null, "body": "|Company|Symbol|Price|Change|Change%|Analytics|\n|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|[Credit Suisse AG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TVIX)|TVIX|18.15|-1.49|-7.59| [HOVER: More Info](/s \"MarketCap: None \\ EPS: None \\ P/E Ratio: None \\ Last Report: Sep 30, 4:00PM EDT\")\n\n^^_Quotr ^^Bot ^^v1.0 ^^by ^^[spookyyz](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=spookyyz&amp;subject=Quotr%20Bot)_", "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1475336504.0, "approved_by": null, "created_utc": 1475307704.0, "user_reports": [], "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Company&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Symbol&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Change&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Change%&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Analytics&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TVIX\"&gt;Credit Suisse AG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;TVIX&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;18.15&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;-1.49&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;-7.59&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"MarketCap: None \\ EPS: None \\ P/E Ratio: None \\ Last Report: Sep 30, 4:00PM EDT\"&gt;HOVER: More Info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;_Quotr&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

Make sure your ship is wide enough to keep it form rolling over and flipping.  Try to design it so that it is hydrodynamic. \n\nKeep the bottom of the ship heavy with stone or lead  blocks if necessary so that the center of mass is low. In build mode you will be able to see this and it is key you pay attention to it. Also place thrust directly behind the center of mass for the best ship speed. \n\nAir pumps remove water and are the best way to increase buoyancy and require that the hull be sealed off from the water  for them to work (they will tell you if the hull is breached or not).  It is very helpful to partition the hull into smaller segments so that a single hull breach will flood the ship. In 16littlejay's design the hull of the ship is 3 metal blocks thick, but there are spaces in between the armor which have air pumps in them. This allows for a heavily armored, yet buoyant ship. Using wood for internal areas where armor is not a necessity will help to increase buoyancy as well. When moving through the water hydrofoils can be employed to lift the ship higher and increase the top speed.  Really my only critique of his design is that it could be slight wider. \n\nIt is actually a good thing of the ships rides low in the water because water offers your ship great protection. I try to keep my deck about 3-4m above the water line if that. If you are still having trouble with bouncy perhaps you are using too much armor?  \n\nAs far as advanced cannons, I like to have one turret that shoots smaller faster projectiles capable of penetrating through an entire ship assuming no shields. This can be done with a slightly smaller gauge than used with explosive shells while still using 1-3m clips. This will allow for enough gunpowder casing to get a fast shell velocity. I like to use a sabot head and body, and a normal body.  These cannons will shred non-shielded enemies as they will seemingly ignore armor and punch right through to ammo storage and AI.  To get a faster fire rate use a shit load of belt fed autoloaders and coolers, more barrels and recoil absorbers are important as well. \n\nFor explosive advanced cannons, I prefer a gauge of 250-500mm and 2-3m long clips. I like to keep these shells at lower speeds (around 200-400) m/s so they have a greater chance of penetrating shields. I like to use a shaped charge head and 1-2 HE bodies depending on the size of a shell. I usually end the shell with the a piece that explodes after a certain level of armor penetration or angular deflection (I forget what they are called).  Also check out the graviton ram attachment it could be very useful. \n\nI think the two. most important parts of building an advanced cannon is making efficient use of space (look at some designs of turrets on ships of steam workshop for this). And secondly, armoring your turrets well both above as bellow deck. The work thing that can happen is your turrets exploding below deck and causing a chain reaction bc internal armor is too weak. \n\nAs far as engines go, basically injectors are the best way to add power, but at a cost to efficiency, and always have exhaust going outside the vehicle. You can now place prefab engines ((called riptide I think) and if you click on it there are beginning middle and end segments so that you can make your engine as big as you want)) that I like a lot, they have good power and efficiency so just study those. \n\nHere is the link to my ship I built using the customizable destroyer hull design.

What are we, Germany?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a more serious note: I get the fact that this is a move to help out Swiss businesses, but patriotism doesn&amp;#39;t incline me to pay more for the same product just because I&amp;#39;m buying it in Switzerland. Maybe, just maybe, instead of making me want to shop online less, make me want to buy domestically more? You know, better service, higher quality, unique products and otherwise innovating a.k.a. adapting to the economy? No? You&amp;#39;re going to sit on your ass and demand a 400% tax on Chinese imports to make Swiss electronics manufacturing more competitive?

But it would also have much smaller and lighter pistons so the con-rods won&amp;#39;t have as much inertial force to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "author_flair_css_class": null, "likes": null, "score": 2, "mod_reports": []}, {"saved": false, "id": "d89kyh3", "ups": 1, "link_id": "t3_558ly1", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "todayilearned", "author": "selfieied", "parent_id": "t1_d88xu1a", "score_hidden": false, "chain": [{"saved": false, "id": "d88ggfr", "ups": 3, "link_id": "t3_558ly1", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "todayilearned", "author": "Claxxon", "parent_id": "t3_558ly1", "score_hidden": false, "banned_by": null, "controversiality": 1, "downs": 0, "name": "t1_d88ggfr", "edited": 1475258771.0, "removal_reason": null, "body": "That's like 2 trillion USD in Afghanistan.\n\n/s", "archived": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1475281349.0, "approved_by": null, "created_utc": 1475252549.0, "user_reports": [], "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s like 2 trillion USD in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;/s&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "author_flair_css_class": null, "likes": null, "score": 3, "mod_reports": []}, {"saved": false, "id": "d88hl88", "ups": 8, "link_id": "t3_558ly1", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qqjc", "stickied": false, "author_flair_text": null, "gilded": 0, "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null, "subreddit": "todayilearned", "author": "Finneshim", "parent_id": "t1_d88ggfr", "score_hidden": false, "banned_by": null, "controversiality": 0, "downs": 0, "name": "t1_d88hl88", "edited": false, "removal_reason": null, "body": "No, it's like $100 USD.
