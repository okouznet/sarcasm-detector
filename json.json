I personally think you have the characters mischaracterised, and I don't like your other gripes.\n\nThe main thing is the characters. Senjougahara (the main girl) starts off being a typical 'violent tsundere'. This is because she's trying to push everyone away from her so they don't find out about her low weight because of the Weight Crab. As the series progresses, her insults to Araragi become affectionate to the point that they aren't nearly as common nor abrasive, and she stops being physically violent.\n\nHachikuji (the lost, little girl) I don't have as strong a case against your interpretation, but I do think she is a nice character and is more of a character for Araragi to interact with and play off, really. I don't like the groping bits either, they were one of my major gripes with the show, but again they aren't *as* prevalant later on and Hachikuji even points out to Araragi that she doesn't mind and it's really just a performance/play between them (when he tells her he's seen the error of his ways). Again, I know this doesn't justify it but it's something I can overlook given it's not completely non-conformant with Araragi's characterisation, isn't too prevalant, and is justified between the characters.\n\nNadeko (the \"I have feelings for onii-chan\" girl) is meant to be generic, this is actually quite an important part of her character and it gets developed on in her next arc. I personally like her design, though!\n\nRegarding Hanekawa (\"big-boobed cat girl\"), it's important to remember that we view the series through the narrator, Araragi,'s eyes, which is why there's a small focus on Hanekawa being \"the ideal woman\", aesthetically, because that is what she is to Araragi. She's the ideal he feels he could never be good enough for, and ultimately stopped pursuing because of that. This is also quite interesting as a part of Hanekawa's development is about how she feels like she has to hold herself up to ridiculous standards, yet feels she is actually very selfish. She hates that people think she's perfect, and she liked Araragi at first because he treated her rather normally, though eventually he came to see her as the perfect woman.\n\nI don't like the fanservice either, but I went into that with it being from Araragi's viewpoint. I think a lot of the fanservice is questionable and I would rather be without, but there's also a lot that isn't so bad. The panty shot scene you're referring to is from the very start of the series (Kizumonogatari) and is when Araragi, at that time a loner who pretends \"having friends will lower [his] intensity as a human\", meets Hanekawa who, against his protests, becomes his friend. So I think the fanservice in that scene was meant to be a parody of similar scenes in other material, maybe?\n\nThe story isn't really meant to be interesting in the way I think you mean. Monogatari is a character driven show at heart. It has some enjoyable action at times (see Suruga Monkey fight, Nisemonogatari final fight and fight with Karen) but if character driven plotlines and interactions don't appeal to you, the show just probably isn't for you. I also think that's the case if you don't like the \"slides\"/artsy presentation of it. Besides the fact that it's not necessary to view the still frames (which have sentences from the point of view of characters to (briefly) show what's going on their heads, not \"deep quotes\"), I never really found it annoying. At least if you do, it's much less prevalant as the series goes on, since in Bakemonogatari a lot of the artsy direction is due to having a low budget, I believe.\n\nAt least we can certainly agree on the music, haha. I really like Renai Circulation, and it has a nice companion in Mousou Express which is the OP for the second Nadeko arc; I'd suggest listening to it if you liked Renai Circulation.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": "MAL", "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you&amp;#39;re perfectly entitled to your own opinion on Bakemonogatari, especially with a show as polarising as the Monogatari series, but I&amp;#39;d like to share/argue what I like about the show. I personally think you have the characters mischaracterised, and I don&amp;#39;t like your other gripes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main thing is the characters. Senjougahara (the main girl) starts off being a typical &amp;#39;violent tsundere&amp;#39;. This is because she&amp;#39;s trying to push everyone away from her so they don&amp;#39;t find out about her low weight because of the Weight Crab. As the series progresses, her insults to Araragi become affectionate to the point that they aren&amp;#39;t nearly as common nor abrasive, and she stops being physically violent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hachikuji (the lost, little girl) I don&amp;#39;t have as strong a case against your interpretation, but I do think she is a nice character and is more of a character for Araragi to interact with and play off, really. I don&amp;#39;t like the groping bits either, they were one of my major gripes with the show, but again they aren&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; prevalant later on and Hachikuji even points out to Araragi that she doesn&amp;#39;t mind and it&amp;#39;s really just a performance/play between them (when he tells her he&amp;#39;s seen the error of his ways). Again, I know this doesn&amp;#39;t justify it but it&amp;#39;s something I can overlook given it&amp;#39;s not completely non-conformant with Araragi&amp;#39;s characterisation, isn&amp;#39;t too prevalant, and is justified between the characters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nadeko (the &amp;quot;I have feelings for onii-chan&amp;quot; girl) is meant to be generic, this is actually quite an important part of her character and it gets developed on in her next arc.

My point is, and we'll choose the Christian god here, that god is a magnificent benefactor full of infinite love, wisdom, compassion, etc. Going new testament here for the sake of convenience, before god's great remix in the old testament, he was kind of a dick.\n\nSo you ask people who is god, they say he's the father of all life and being, he's infinite love, compassion, etc. So you ask how they know, they say because it's in a book and everybody knows that. If you keep going with that, it boils down to \"because god said so.\" I mean, I can come up to you on the street and say that I'm an eccentric billionaire and I want to make your day by giving you $10,000,000, but you have to spend the next 20 years doing nice shit for people, respecting your neighbors, generally not being a dick, etc. If you're like me, you'll probably get a good laugh and carry on about your business.

Awesome!\" and then start immediately serving/worshipping him. It's pretty clear that the god complex in that example is a matter of circumstances, as in \"You're bigger than me, I can't figure out why, want a free statue?\" So ultimately, assuming god exists, it's kinda irresponsible to just take him/her/it/that/etc. at it's word. How about some fucking references, or some proof, or some actual good deeds to *prove* the mysterious space benefactor angle? Because as I see it, as a non-believer but still open to the idea, all we've got now is hearsay and weird diseases.\n\nThe other point, that god is dead, goes off the assumption that god at least existed at one point, but doesn't anymore. Look at the bible, there haven't been any additions to it in a *pretty* long time. All kinds of awesome shit was happening in the bible - wars between heaven and hell, divine espionage, burning bushes that said stuff, talking snakes, the heavens and earth moving on a whim, direct communication, etc. What happened between now and then? As human civilization advanced through the years, god hasn't really been in the picture, nor has satan, or any of the other fantastic shit going on back then. My argument is that if god and the gang existed, they're either dead, forgot about us, or willfully abandoned us. Look at the world around you. Science and medicine have lead to overpopulation, wars are being fought over shit people are finding in the ground and who's god can beat up who's god, kids are born with cancer, insects lay eggs in people's eyes and brains, etc. It's not exactly the thriving utopia we were promised, and god hasn't said fuck all to anyone except the clinically insane. That's also kind of a big deal.\n\nSo to summarize, I'm not trying to say \"religion is stupid and people should think otherwise,\" I'm trying to say maybe we need to analyze religion in the modern world and why god/s aren't as involved as they used to be.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the thing about morality though - it varies personally and culturally.

That&amp;#39;s also kind of a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to summarize, I&amp;#39;m not trying to say &amp;quot;religion is stupid and people should think otherwise,&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m trying to say maybe we need to analyze religion in the modern world and why god/s aren&amp;#39;t as involved as they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_55bwwj", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_d89d1wy", "created": 1475336470.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1475307670.0, "ups": 2, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhq", "chain": [{"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhhq", "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "investing", "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d89d1ue", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "stickied": false, "author": "DrunkCircusBear", "parent_id": "t3_55ca3w", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "Just swing trading $TVIX until after the election.", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just swing trading $TVIX until after the election.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "link_id": "t3_55ca3w", "score_hidden": false, "name": "t1_d89d1ue", "created": 1475336464.0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1475307664.0, "ups": 1, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "distinguished": null}], "banned_by": null, "removal_reason": null, "subreddit": "investing", "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "d89d2a3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "stickied": false, "author": "_Quotr", "parent_id": "t1_d89d1ue", "score": 1, "approved_by": null, "report_reasons": null, "controversiality": 0, "body": "|Company|Symbol|Price|Change|Change%|Analytics|\n|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|[Credit Suisse AG](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TVIX)|TVIX|18.15|-1.49|-7.59| [HOVER: More Info](/s \"MarketCap: None \\ EPS: None \\ P/E Ratio: None \\ Last Report: Sep 30, 4:00PM EDT\")\n\n^^_Quotr ^^Bot ^^v1.0 ^^by ^^[spookyyz](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=spookyyz&amp;subject=Quotr%20Bot)_", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Company&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Symbol&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Change&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Change%&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Analytics&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=TVIX\"&gt;Credit Suisse AG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;TVIX&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;18.15&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;-1.49&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;-7.59&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"MarketCap: None \\ EPS: None \\ P/E Ratio: None \\ Last Report: Sep 30, 4:00PM EDT\"&gt;HOVER: More Info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;_Quotr&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

Make sure your ship is wide enough to keep it form rolling over and flipping.  Try to design it so that it is hydrodynamic. \n\nKeep the bottom of the ship heavy with stone or lead  blocks if necessary so that the center of mass is low. In build mode you will be able to see this and it is key you pay attention to it. Also place thrust directly behind the center of mass for the best ship speed. \n\nAir pumps remove water and are the best way to increase buoyancy and require that the hull be sealed off from the water  for them to work (they will tell you if the hull is breached or not).  It is very helpful to partition the hull into smaller segments so that a single hull breach will flood the ship. In 16littlejay's design the hull of the ship is 3 metal blocks thick, but there are spaces in between the armor which have air pumps in them. This allows for a heavily armored, yet buoyant ship. Using wood for internal areas where armor is not a necessity will help to increase buoyancy as well. When moving through the water hydrofoils can be employed to lift the ship higher and increase the top speed.  Really my only critique of his design is that it could be slight wider. \n\nIt is actually a good thing of the ships rides low in the water because water offers your ship great protection. I try to keep my deck about 3-4m above the water line if that. If you are still having trouble with bouncy perhaps you are using too much armor?  \n\nAs far as advanced cannons, I like to have one turret that shoots smaller faster projectiles capable of penetrating through an entire ship assuming no shields. This can be done with a slightly smaller gauge than used with explosive shells while still using 1-3m clips. This will allow for enough gunpowder casing to get a fast shell velocity. I like to use a sabot head and body, and a normal body.  These cannons will shred non-shielded enemies as they will seemingly ignore armor and punch right through to ammo storage and AI.  To get a faster fire rate use a shit load of belt fed autoloaders and coolers, more barrels and recoil absorbers are important as well. \n\nFor explosive advanced cannons, I prefer a gauge of 250-500mm and 2-3m long clips. I like to keep these shells at lower speeds (around 200-400) m/s so they have a greater chance of penetrating shields. I like to use a shaped charge head and 1-2 HE bodies depending on the size of a shell. I usually end the shell with the a piece that explodes after a certain level of armor penetration or angular deflection (I forget what they are called).  Also check out the graviton ram attachment it could be very useful. \n\nI think the two. most important parts of building an advanced cannon is making efficient use of space (look at some designs of turrets on ships of steam workshop for this). And secondly, armoring your turrets well both above as bellow deck. The work thing that can happen is your turrets exploding below deck and causing a chain reaction bc internal armor is too weak. \n\nAs far as engines go, basically injectors are the best way to add power, but at a cost to efficiency, and always have exhaust going outside the vehicle. You can now place prefab engines ((called riptide I think) and if you click on it there are beginning middle and end segments so that you can make your engine as big as you want)) that I like a lot, they have good power and efficiency so just study those. \n\nHere is the link to my ship I built using the customizable destroyer hull design.
