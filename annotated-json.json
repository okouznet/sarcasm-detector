There is just too much information in Bake to notice everything you need to notice. You miss so much about the characters since you&amp;#39;re struggling to keep up with wtf is going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just to expand on some things &lt;a href=\"/u/Seraphaestus\"&gt;/u/Seraphaestus&lt;/a&gt; mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Senjougahara basically has asperger&amp;#39;s at the moment and you should just treat her like an autistic kid. She&amp;#39;s been emotionless for 2 years and now has problems displaying her emotions. Remember in the first episode Araragi mentions that all she does is read? She flat out says I&amp;#39;m a tsundere, and she guesses Oshino is a moe character because of his name. That&amp;#39;s how her thought process works at the moment - she can only relate her emotions to things she&amp;#39;s been reading about for the past 2 years. There&amp;#39;s a lot more to her character that makes her much more interesting (she&amp;#39;s one of my favorite anime chars) but hope that addresses why she&amp;#39;s all batshit crazy in bake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"her job as a lost snail oddity is to get people who don&amp;#39;t want to go home lost\"&gt;Hachikuji &lt;/a&gt; however she doesn&amp;#39;t like this so she actively tried (literally and metaphorically) to push people she met away. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJBb4nVhtjs\"&gt;Read the lyrics to her second OP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lost but not at a loss&lt;br/&gt;\nI met you&lt;br/&gt;\nAs you pretend to tease and bother me&lt;br/&gt;\nI pretend to be a little angry&lt;br/&gt;\nAnd savor the mundane joy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The groping started when she lamented how he was her first touch so he responded with &amp;quot;oh yeah? I&amp;#39;ll grope you so hard you won&amp;#39;t care about that.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s all just playful banter between the two, nothing sexual. Notice how after Nadeko&amp;#39;s arc when Nadeko is thanking him he tries to playfully lift her skirt (he stops before he actually does). She doesn&amp;#39;t react though and he stops messing with her after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just like &lt;a href=\"/u/Seraphaestus\"&gt;/u/Seraphaestus&lt;/a&gt; said, Nadeko is generic on purpose, watch her later arc when she becomes awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hanekawa is pretty generic on purpose also, except they hint that there&amp;#39;s more to it at the end.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully both our walls of text are enough to atleast convince you that the characters aren&amp;#39;t utter trash and you give the rest a shot.

It&amp;#39;s worth it though to get to monogatari second season.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "banned_by": null, "num_reports": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "archived": false, "author_flair_css_class": "MAL", "link_id": "t3_557cok", "body": "OP I felt similar to you after finishing Bake, but after finishing the series it's become my favorite franchise purely for the characters. \n\nMonogatari is all about the relationships the MC has with each character (at least before the plot gets crazy like it does later). There is just too much information in Bake to notice everything you need to notice. You miss so much about the characters since you're struggling to keep up with wtf is going on.\n\nJust to expand on some things /u/Seraphaestus mentioned.\n\nSenjougahara basically has asperger's at the moment and you should just treat her like an autistic kid. She's been emotionless for 2 years and now has problems displaying her emotions. Remember in the first episode Araragi mentions that all she does is read? She flat out says I'm a tsundere, and she guesses Oshino is a moe character because of his name. That's how her thought process works at the moment - she can only relate her emotions to things she's been reading about for the past 2 years. There's a lot more to her character that makes her much more interesting (she's one of my favorite anime chars) but hope that addresses why she's all batshit crazy in bake.\n\n\n[Hachikuji ](/s \"her job as a lost snail oddity is to get people who don't want to go home lost\") however she doesn't like this so she actively tried (literally and metaphorically) to push people she met away. [Read the lyrics to her second OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJBb4nVhtjs).\n\n&gt;Lost but not at a loss  \n&gt;I met you  \n&gt;As you pretend to tease and bother me  \n&gt;I pretend to be a little angry  \n&gt;And savor the mundane joy.\n\nThe groping started when she lamented how he was her first touch so he responded with \"oh yeah? I'll grope you so hard you won't care about that.\" It's all just playful banter between the two, nothing sexual. Notice how after Nadeko's arc when Nadeko is thanking him he tries to playfully lift her skirt (he stops before he actually does). She doesn't react though and he stops messing with her after that.\n\nJust like /u/Seraphaestus said, Nadeko is generic on purpose, watch her later arc when she becomes awesome.\n\nHanekawa is pretty generic on purpose also, except they hint that there's more to it at the end.\n\nHopefully both our walls of text are enough to atleast convince you that the characters aren't utter trash and you give the rest a shot. Just to warn you though Nisemonogatari is more of a thematic stand alone season compared to the rest. It doesn't focus on the overarching plot aside from introducing important characters so a lot of people consider it filler or don't like it (which is a shame) also the fanservice is in overdrive and it's probably going to be like pulling teeth for you.

She&amp;#39;s the ideal he feels he could never be good enough for, and ultimately stopped pursuing because of that. This is also quite interesting as a part of Hanekawa&amp;#39;s development is about how she feels like she has to hold herself up to ridiculous standards, yet feels she is actually very selfish.

The panty shot scene you&amp;#39;re referring to is from the very start of the series (Kizumonogatari) and is when Araragi, at that time a loner who pretends &amp;quot;having friends will lower [his] intensity as a human&amp;quot;, meets Hanekawa who, against his protests, becomes his friend.

For instance, you mentioned Brahma married his own daughter. Personally, that&amp;#39;s not something I can get behind, and I&amp;#39;m sure there&amp;#39;s a lot of folks that would agree overall. Some people think that falls into a moral gray [or even white] area because it&amp;#39;s a god, and there are different rules. And there are fringe groups that think that&amp;#39;s perfectly fine regardless of who you are. None of that&amp;#39;s really important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before I make my point, I&amp;#39;m not religious, but I respect people&amp;#39;s right to be religious. People can believe whatever they want, I don&amp;#39;t care. My point is, and we&amp;#39;ll choose the Christian god here, that god is a magnificent benefactor full of infinite love, wisdom, compassion, etc. Going new testament here for the sake of convenience, before god&amp;#39;s great remix in the old testament, he was kind of a dick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So you ask people who is god, they say he&amp;#39;s the father of all life and being, he&amp;#39;s infinite love, compassion, etc. So you ask how they know, they say because it&amp;#39;s in a book and everybody knows that. If you keep going with that, it boils down to &amp;quot;because god said so.&amp;quot; I mean, I can come up to you on the street and say that I&amp;#39;m an eccentric billionaire and I want to make your day by giving you $10,000,000, but you have to spend the next 20 years doing nice shit for people, respecting your neighbors, generally not being a dick, etc. If you&amp;#39;re like me, you&amp;#39;ll probably get a good laugh and carry on about your business. If not, you&amp;#39;re taking me at face value over something I said, as a complete stranger on the street, and assuming that it&amp;#39;s going to happen. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So ultimately my point was that assuming god exists, and assuming that the bible [in this instance] is an accurate documentation of the life and times of god and early civilization, we really need to take a second to say &amp;quot;says fucking who?&amp;quot; There was a really great Twilight Zone episode where these guys end up stranded on a remote planet, and one of them finds this civilization of tiny little people, and they say &amp;quot;Oh shit, it&amp;#39;s god! Awesome!&amp;quot; and then start immediately serving/worshipping him. It&amp;#39;s pretty clear that the god complex in that example is a matter of circumstances, as in &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re bigger than me, I can&amp;#39;t figure out why, want a free statue?&amp;quot; So ultimately, assuming god exists, it&amp;#39;s kinda irresponsible to just take him/her/it/that/etc. at it&amp;#39;s word. How about some fucking references, or some proof, or some actual good deeds to &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; the mysterious space benefactor angle? Because as I see it, as a non-believer but still open to the idea, all we&amp;#39;ve got now is hearsay and weird diseases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other point, that god is dead, goes off the assumption that god at least existed at one point, but doesn&amp;#39;t anymore. Look at the bible, there haven&amp;#39;t been any additions to it in a &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; long time. All kinds of awesome shit was happening in the bible - wars between heaven and hell, divine espionage, burning bushes that said stuff, talking snakes, the heavens and earth moving on a whim, direct communication, etc. What happened between now and then? As human civilization advanced through the years, god hasn&amp;#39;t really been in the picture, nor has satan, or any of the other fantastic shit going on back then. My argument is that if god and the gang existed, they&amp;#39;re either dead, forgot about us, or willfully abandoned us. Look at the world around you.

That&amp;#39;s also kind of a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to summarize, I&amp;#39;m not trying to say &amp;quot;religion is stupid and people should think otherwise,&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m trying to say maybe we need to analyze religion in the modern world and why god/s aren&amp;#39;t as involved as they used to be.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "banned_by": null, "num_reports": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "archived": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "link_id": "t3_55bwwj", "body": "That's the thing about morality though - it varies personally and culturally. For instance, you mentioned Brahma married his own daughter. Personally, that's not something I can get behind, and I'm sure there's a lot of folks that would agree overall. Some people think that falls into a moral gray [or even white] area because it's a god, and there are different rules. And there are fringe groups that think that's perfectly fine regardless of who you are. None of that's really important.\n\nBefore I make my point, I'm not religious, but I respect people's right to be religious. People can believe whatever they want, I don't care. My point is, and we'll choose the Christian god here, that god is a magnificent benefactor full of infinite love, wisdom, compassion, etc. Going new testament here for the sake of convenience, before god's great remix in the old testament, he was kind of a dick.\n\nSo you ask people who is god, they say he's the father of all life and being, he's infinite love, compassion, etc. So you ask how they know, they say because it's in a book and everybody knows that. If you keep going with that, it boils down to \"because god said so.\" I mean, I can come up to you on the street and say that I'm an eccentric billionaire and I want to make your day by giving you $10,000,000, but you have to spend the next 20 years doing nice shit for people, respecting your neighbors, generally not being a dick, etc. If you're like me, you'll probably get a good laugh and carry on about your business. If not, you're taking me at face value over something I said, as a complete stranger on the street, and assuming that it's going to happen. \n\nSo ultimately my point was that assuming god exists, and assuming that the bible [in this instance] is an accurate documentation of the life and times of god and early civilization, we really need to take a second to say \"says fucking who?\" There was a really great Twilight Zone episode where these guys end up stranded on a remote planet, and one of them finds this civilization of tiny little people, and they say \"Oh shit, it's god! Awesome!\" and then start immediately serving/worshipping him. It's pretty clear that the god complex in that example is a matter of circumstances, as in \"You're bigger than me, I can't figure out why, want a free statue?\" So ultimately, assuming god exists, it's kinda irresponsible to just take him/her/it/that/etc. at it's word. How about some fucking references, or some proof, or some actual good deeds to *prove* the mysterious space benefactor angle? Because as I see it, as a non-believer but still open to the idea, all we've got now is hearsay and weird diseases.\n\nThe other point, that god is dead, goes off the assumption that god at least existed at one point, but doesn't anymore. Look at the bible, there haven't been any additions to it in a *pretty* long time. All kinds of awesome shit was happening in the bible - wars between heaven and hell, divine espionage, burning bushes that said stuff, talking snakes, the heavens and earth moving on a whim, direct communication, etc. What happened between now and then? As human civilization advanced through the years, god hasn't really been in the picture, nor has satan, or any of the other fantastic shit going on back then. My argument is that if god and the gang existed, they're either dead, forgot about us, or willfully abandoned us. Look at the world around you. Science and medicine have lead to overpopulation, wars are being fought over shit people are finding in the ground and who's god can beat up who's god, kids are born with cancer, insects lay eggs in people's eyes and brains, etc. It's not exactly the thriving utopia we were promised, and god hasn't said fuck all to anyone except the clinically insane. That's also kind of a big deal.\n\nSo to summarize, I'm not trying to say \"religion is stupid and people should think otherwise,\" I'm trying to say maybe we need to analyze religion in the modern world and why god/s aren't as involved as they used to be.", "gilded": 0, "controversiality": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "chain": [{"subreddit": "AskReddit", "score": 2, "ups": 2, "name": "t1_d899ycr", "downs": 0, "score_hidden": false, "mod_reports": [], "created": 1475327599.0, "archived": false, "author": "pizzapede", "stickied": false, "saved": false, "created_utc": 1475298799.0, "distinguished": null, "removal_reason": null, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "approved_by": null, "edited": false, "report_reasons": null, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because if god does exist, it might not be who people are told it is.

The sparkling apple containing the life force of Whispy Woods is an exception.

While the final battles are action-packed, Haltmann&amp;#39;s cries make it eerie during the battle against &lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"Star Dream Soul OS\"&gt;Spoiler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither of the two.

The most lives at stake was everything if Star Dream could have succeeded (*Planet Robobot*) or if Marx wished for destruction of the entire realm (*Super Star*). \nIf the *military* definition of a casualty is applied, then there would also be quite a bit in *Triple Deluxe* (People of the Sky). Counting the bosses possessed by Dark Matter as casualties in *Dream Land 3* would be a good amount of them too. \n\n2. In the anime, whoever and whatever Kirby inhales is usually trapped inside a dimension. The sparkling apple containing the life force of Whispy Woods is an exception. In the games, he must have some kind of special digestive system with a special enzyme to transform things into what he spits into his primary weapon without an ability - a star. If anything, I think they would simply be devoured.\n\n3. Many abilities would be painful, but I believe that Bomb, Stone, Missile, Crash, Plasma/Spark, Jet, Laser (depends on lethality), and UFO would hurt the most of all.\n\n4. I have to say that Planet Robobot is the most unsettling story in the entire *Kirby* series. The backstory of Haltmann and Susie is among the most terrifying in the series, which I have totally unexpected. While the final battles are action-packed, Haltmann's cries make it eerie during the battle against [Spoiler](/s \"Star Dream Soul OS\").\n\n5. Neither of the two.

It is very helpful to partition the hull into smaller segments so that a single hull breach will flood the ship. In 16littlejay&amp;#39;s design the hull of the ship is 3 metal blocks thick, but there are spaces in between the armor which have air pumps in them. This allows for a heavily armored, yet buoyant ship. Using wood for internal areas where armor is not a necessity will help to increase buoyancy as well. When moving through the water hydrofoils can be employed to lift the ship higher and increase the top speed.  Really my only critique of his design is that it could be slight wider. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is actually a good thing of the ships rides low in the water because water offers your ship great protection. I try to keep my deck about 3-4m above the water line if that. If you are still having trouble with bouncy perhaps you are using too much armor?  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as advanced cannons, I like to have one turret that shoots smaller faster projectiles capable of penetrating through an entire ship assuming no shields. This can be done with a slightly smaller gauge than used with explosive shells while still using 1-3m clips. This will allow for enough gunpowder casing to get a fast shell velocity. I like to use a sabot head and body, and a normal body.  These cannons will shred non-shielded enemies as they will seemingly ignore armor and punch right through to ammo storage and AI.  To get a faster fire rate use a shit load of belt fed autoloaders and coolers, more barrels and recoil absorbers are important as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For explosive advanced cannons, I prefer a gauge of 250-500mm and 2-3m long clips. I like to keep these shells at lower speeds (around 200-400) m/s so they have a greater chance of penetrating shields. I like to use a shaped charge head and 1-2 HE bodies depending on the size of a shell. I usually end the shell with the a piece that explodes after a certain level of armor penetration or angular deflection (I forget what they are called).  Also check out the graviton ram attachment it could be very useful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the two. most important parts of building an advanced cannon is making efficient use of space (look at some designs of turrets on ships of steam workshop for this). And secondly, armoring your turrets well both above as bellow deck. The work thing that can happen is your turrets exploding below deck and causing a chain reaction bc internal armor is too weak. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as engines go, basically injectors are the best way to add power, but at a cost to efficiency, and always have exhaust going outside the vehicle.

(~30ms)\n\n\n**2degrees**\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Excellent service and support\n* Excellent speeds &amp; international routing\n* Modem provided (FritzBox! 7490)\n* VERY knowledgeable staff, even on their FB Page. \n* Dynamic IP by default, no CGNAT\n* IPv6 Support\n* Traffic managed in Christchurch, low latency to Dunedin services (~10ms)\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Mostly contract based\n* Monthly Static IP Fee (+$10)\n* Phone support lines are often saturated\n\nIt's been a few months since we left BigPipe so a few things might have changed since then. We only left due to being a frequent target of DDoS attacks (Absolutely not their fault), had an impact on other BigPipe customers too, which isn't fair on anyone. \n\nTransferring files between home and Polytech has been absolutely amazing with 2degrees, easily getting ~50MB/s over FTP. \n\nLet me know if you have any further questions, I'm sure /u/BigPipeNZ will be able to tell you more about their excellent service.
