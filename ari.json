With a 16k connection i have a upload around 1mb and a 4 times faster connection should be aroun 4mb and not 10.

Lets say your space capsule has a mass of 1 ton, has an engine and fuel tank that weigh another ton, and is conveniently in orbit already. \n\nSo, how much fuel can that tank hold?  Your rocket engine only works while it has fuel, right (just like your car needs gas in its tank, or your cell phone needs charge in it's battery)\n\nThere was a really smart Russian by the name of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky that figured this out in the late 1800's\n\nHe figured out this.\n\nThe change in velocity (delta-v) is equal to\n\nYour rocket's exhaust velocity x the natural log of its fully fueled mass divided by it's empty mass\n\ndelta v = velocity of exhaust * ln (mass full/mass empty)\n\nSo say your 1 ton of fuel tank and engine can hold 10 tons of fuel\n\nand lets say you are burning liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen (nearly the best bang for the buck with chemical rocket engines that don't use scary things like fluorine)\n\nLooking on the internet the characteristic exhaust velocity of LOx/LH is 2435m/s\nthe natural log of (12 tons (full) divided by 2 tons (empty tanks + capsule and engines) is 1.79175946923\n\n2435 m/s * 1.7917 is 4363 meters/second once the fuel is all burned\n\nsounds fast, doesn't it?  but the speed of light is 300,000 meters/second.\n\nSo lets build another bigger rocket that will take our 12 ton rocket, and boost it, using a big tank of fuel and more rocket engines, say 6 tons of engines and tank, and 60 tons of LOx/LH\n\nExhaust velocity is the same 2435 but now that empty tanks mass is 12 tons for the original capsule with rocket and engines, plus 6 more tons of tanks and rockets on the new booster, so the natural log (or ln for short) of 78/18 is 1.4662\n\nso  2435 m/s * 1.4662 is 3570 m/s added to our velocity at first stage burnout\n\nFuel is the limiter.\n\nThink about driving a car across a desert (no gas stations).  How much gas could you practically carry?  And that Gas is not weightless--your car would be slower and less efficient with the additional fuel loaded onboard\n\nThat is why we can't go super freaking fast--every way you have ever watched NASA or any other space agency or company launch has rockets that have to run out of fuel (no cheat codes for infinite fuel!)\n\nOkay, chemical rockets suck. What else can you do.\n\n1. Nuclear. \nChucking bombs out the back end of a Orion type spaceship, pushing the ship forward when they are exploded.\nRunning Hydrogen over the hot surface of a nuclear reactor core and exhausting the superheated Hydrogen gas out the tailpipe\n\n2. Ion/Plasma\nZapping a gas with electricity or microwaves to strip off some electrons (making a gas of 'ions' or an ionized gas) and accelerating those ions using electromagnetic fields\n\nOkay those are great, and more efficient, but Nuclear is not popular, and ion engines are incredibly efficient, but accelerate very slowly.\n\nWhat if you didn't bring the fuel with you?\n\nSolar Sails, using the Sun's light, or using a large laser to bounce photons (light) off a reflective surface (the sail).  Light has no mass, but it does have momentum, which can be transferred to an object.  So Light can push the sail.  \n\nThe concept to use a large number of powerful lasers to push a sail to Proxima Centauri (the nearest star to our Sun) has been proposed.\n\nThe problem with sails is that light intensity drops off by the distance squared.  So if you are twice the distance away, you get a quarter (1/2^2) of the light, and three times away you get a ninth (1/3^3) of the light\n\nSo there are some suggestions that there are some corners of Physics we don't understand completely yet, and might allow a propellentless drive (see the EM drive) however, the thrust of these devices seem to be tiny tiny tiny.\n\nI hope this helps.\n \n", "num_reports": null, "chain": [{"body": "\n&gt;if you just keep your rocket's boosters on? \n\nIn other words, bringing an infinitely large supply of fuel with you.\n\nThis turns out to be difficult.", "num_reports": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "subreddit": "space", "removal_reason": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1475288857.0, "name": "t1_d894vi8", "parent_id": "t3_55bc1c", "banned_by": null, "author": "WabashWombat", "link_id": "t3_55bc1c", "user_reports": [], "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;if you just keep your rocket&amp;#39;s boosters on? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In other words, bringing an infinitely large supply of fuel with you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This turns out to be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "created": 1475317657.0, "id": "d894vi8", "mod_reports": [], "archived": false, "likes": null, "score": 5, "distinguished": null, "score_hidden": false, "gilded": 0, "controversiality": 0, "ups": 5, "report_reasons": null, "edited": false, "approved_by": null, "saved": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh87"}, {"body": "So you can go as fast as you want depending on the amount of fuel you have?

What else can you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuclear. \nChucking bombs out the back end of a Orion type spaceship, pushing the ship forward when they are exploded.\nRunning Hydrogen over the hot surface of a nuclear reactor core and exhausting the superheated Hydrogen gas out the tailpipe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ion/Plasma\nZapping a gas with electricity or microwaves to strip off some electrons (making a gas of &amp;#39;ions&amp;#39; or an ionized gas) and accelerating those ions using electromagnetic fields&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay those are great, and more efficient, but Nuclear is not popular, and ion engines are incredibly efficient, but accelerate very slowly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What if you didn&amp;#39;t bring the fuel with you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solar Sails, using the Sun&amp;#39;s light, or using a large laser to bounce photons (light) off a reflective surface (the sail).  Light has no mass, but it does have momentum, which can be transferred to an object.  So Light can push the sail.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The concept to use a large number of powerful lasers to push a sail to Proxima Centauri (the nearest star to our Sun) has been proposed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem with sails is that light intensity drops off by the distance squared.  So if you are twice the distance away, you get a quarter (1/2&lt;sup&gt;2)&lt;/sup&gt; of the light, and three times away you get a ninth (1/3&lt;sup&gt;3)&lt;/sup&gt; of the light&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there are some suggestions that there are some corners of Physics we don&amp;#39;t understand completely yet, and might allow a propellentless drive (see the EM drive) however, the thrust of these devices seem to be tiny tiny tiny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "created": 1475320361.0, "id": "d896elr", "mod_reports": [], "archived": false, "likes": null, "score": 4, "distinguished": null, "score_hidden": false, "gilded": 0, "controversiality": 0, "ups": 4, "report_reasons": null, "edited": false, "approved_by": null, "saved": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh87", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"body": "Mob has a Hulk-esque feel when he uses his powers rather than someone holding back despite its truth.

I'll try to do a breakdown explanation of each game to clarify what I'm saying.\n\n1) Neptune is the sole main protagonist. As a character, Neptune is a jokester-optimist and slacker who only gets serious when it's really important, but when she does, she gets shit done. Saving Arfiore was something she alone decided was possible, and everyone else fled, hence it was fitting to have a duel.\n\n2) Nepgear is the sole main protagonist. The story is about Nepgear's growth from a nerve-wracked unsure girl to a proper hero. Because this is Nepgear's story, her facing down the source of her fears and winning makes for a fitting conclusion. (At least I think it's like that, I haven't actually gotten the true ending of Mk2 v_v;)\n\nVII) Neptune, Nepgear and Uzuzume are tri-tagonists. But, Uzume has a reason to duel the final boss because [VII](/s \"it's her. If anything the battle could be viewed as a metaphor for her inner conflicts. Coming to terms with, getting in control of, and ultimately accepting the worse parts of herself.\") \n\nV) Neptune and Plutia are dual-tagonists (In my opinion anyway. There's no denying Neptune's role as a main protag though). Plutia has no reason to duel Rei in this one. It's not really her personality to get serious, and the final boss Rei isn't even the one threatening her dimension. Maybe there's some argument for Neptune having a duel with Rei, but it kinda detracts from the idea of having dual-tagonists, and steals the limelight away from the new character.

As a character, Neptune is a jokester-optimist and slacker who only gets serious when it&amp;#39;s really important, but when she does, she gets shit done. Saving Arfiore was something she alone decided was possible, and everyone else fled, hence it was fitting to have a duel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Nepgear is the sole main protagonist. The story is about Nepgear&amp;#39;s growth from a nerve-wracked unsure girl to a proper hero. Because this is Nepgear&amp;#39;s story, her facing down the source of her fears and winning makes for a fitting conclusion. (At least I think it&amp;#39;s like that, I haven&amp;#39;t actually gotten the true ending of Mk2 v_v;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VII) Neptune, Nepgear and Uzuzume are tri-tagonists. But, Uzume has a reason to duel the final boss because &lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"it&amp;#39;s her. If anything the battle could be viewed as a metaphor for her inner conflicts. Coming to terms with, getting in control of, and ultimately accepting the worse parts of herself.\"&gt;VII&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;V) Neptune and Plutia are dual-tagonists (In my opinion anyway. There&amp;#39;s no denying Neptune&amp;#39;s role as a main protag though). Plutia has no reason to duel Rei in this one. It&amp;#39;s not really her personality to get serious, and the final boss Rei isn&amp;#39;t even the one threatening her dimension. Maybe there&amp;#39;s some argument for Neptune having a duel with Rei, but it kinda detracts from the idea of having dual-tagonists, and steals the limelight away from the new character. It&amp;#39;s also time in which you might be using the CPU candidates or Peashy who have been unavailable for most of the game, if you want to do that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that made things a little clearer. &lt;sup&gt;sorry for txt wall v.v&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "created": 1475324692.0, "id": "d898no4", "mod_reports": [], "archived": false, "likes": null, "score": 3, "distinguished": null, "score_hidden": false, "gilded": 0, "controversiality": 0, "ups": 3, "report_reasons": null, "edited": 1475296236.0, "approved_by": null, "saved": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2w8vg", "author_flair_css_class": "bsha"}, {"body": "Out of the YuruYuri Illustration book [this is my favourite](http://i.imgur.com/rt8SVgd.jpg)\n\n[](/s \"I like to imagine I took that photo\")", "num_reports": null, "chain": [], "subreddit": "waifuism", "removal_reason": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1475295918.0, "name": "t1_d898o4i", "parent_id": "t3_55at1d", "banned_by": null, "author": "2matolove", "link_id": "t3_55at1d", "user_reports": [], "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the YuruYuri Illustration book &lt;a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/rt8SVgd.jpg\"&gt;this is my favourite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/s\" title=\"I like to imagine I took that photo\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "stickied": false, "created": 1475324718.0, "id": "d898o4i", "mod_reports": [], "archived": false, "likes": null, "score": 3, "distinguished": null, "score_hidden": false, "gilded": 0, "controversiality": 0, "ups": 3, "report_reasons": null, "edited": false, "approved_by": null, "saved": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_32aef", "author_flair_css_class": null}, {"body": "Not really, I like and appreciate competition, and I actually do not like AT&amp;T.\n\nBut the other ISP, Sabernet, was charging me $25 for 1.5Mb/s service, (which isn't even enough bandwidth to stream 720p video), and then they jacked up the price to $35, without increasing the speed, so I hope AT&amp;T crushes them.
