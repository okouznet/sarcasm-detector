Episode 3 just kind of stood out as an even brighter star than the rest of the brilliant constellation.\n\n&gt;To me, episode 3 was my first real moment of realization that Schichika lacked humanity, and truly was a sword, not just some funny goof who was a very skilled fighter.\n\n&gt;Up until that point, the opponents had been tainted by the blades.

She uses non-violent means as a first method in an attempt to shake the resolve of Schichika, instead of immediately trying to kill him. She only resorts to fighting after she discovers the truth about Shcichika's character: he is not a human, he is a sword. By the end of it, I was almost rooting for Meisai, at the very least I wanted her to live, but Schichika did not feel the same way. She was an obstacle to be cut down, regardless of morality.\")\n\n&gt;For me atleast, this episode set the precedent for the beautiful character development throughout the series by allowing us to look back and see how far Schichika had come.

My understanding of your question - and hence what I'll answer is 'What exactly is Holocaust denial, and what aspects of the Holocaust do deniers reject?\" Additionally, I'll discuss how Holocaust deniers deny the Holocaust. I'll also touch on the motivations of deniers, which is inextricably linked with their methodology.\n\n----\n\n**What exactly is Holocaust denial?**\n\nHolocaust denial's best, simple definition is \"the activity of denying the occurrence of key events and processes which constitute the Holocaust.\"1 Since deniers have no unified set of beliefs, exactly which aspect/s of the Holocaust they deny can vary greatly. Almost invariably, their claims boil down to a conclusion stating that the established number of individuals killed by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust - either six or eleven million, depending on whether non-Jewish victims of German mass-murders are included in the total - is false, and that the 'true' number of victims is considerably lower than the above totals.\n\nA Holocaust denier might claim, for instance, that a total of one million Jews were killed (though they will usually also claim they merely 'died' rather than being deliberately murdered), as opposed to the established total of ~six million. Holocaust deniers will often also deny the methodology of the Holocaust. They will often claim that Nazi Germany's 'Final Solution' aimed only to deport Jews from the Reich (as opposed to their mass murder), and may deny any or all of the following: state-organised mass murder of Jews and other minorities; the death camp system; gas chambers in the death camps; and the existence or actions of the SS Einsatzgruppen. The exact nature of what is being denied often varies, but the theme remains clear: Holocaust deniers deny one or more aspects of the Holocaust, and purport that the number of Jews and other minorities murdered in the Holocaust is subsequently lower than the historically established figures.\n\n-----------\n\n**What is the methodology of Holocaust Deniers?**\n\nHolocaust deniers deny the Holocaust in the face of a truly extraordinary mountain of evidence. The factual accuracy of the Holocaust is completely irrefutable, and no rational, informed individual would ever dispute its existence or its methodology. Few, if any, events in history are as well recorded, studied, examined and re-examined as the Holocaust. While there remains, of course, a huge amount to be learned about the minutiae of the Holocaust, its scale and functionality are so thoroughly documented by untold millions of photographs, eyewitness accounts, contemporary documents, film reels and items of physical evidence (for instance, collections of the wedding rings and shoes of those 'processed' through the death camp system or the gas chambers themselves) that rational, evidence-based disputes of its general methodology and progression are non-existent.\n\nHolocaust deniers hence find themselves attempting to deny established fact. They have no significant evidence to support their denial, and hence resort to a variety of methods ranging from fabricated evidence and psuedo-academic argumentation to emotional claims of far-reaching conspiracy - inevitably masterminded by Jews. They will often attempt to dismiss the vast array of evidence demonstrating the existence of the Holocaust as forgeries and lies planted by the above-mentioned conspirators to fool the public, in order to avoid engaging with said evidence. They would likely claim, for instance, that I am a paid shill. Since they aim to propagate lies in the face of insurmountable evidence, they must rely on fallacious verbal arguments, ideological dogma and the exploitation of ignorance to spread their beliefs.\n\nAn excellent example of the above is the writing of Germar Rudolph, a German chemist and Holocaust denier. Rudolph authored a paper in 1991 titled \"Report on the formation and verifiability of cyanide compounds in the Auschwitz gas chambers,\" wherein he asserted various claims against the plausibility of the gas chamber system at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. To the untrained eye, Rudolph's report appears academic, however upon examination it is false in its entirety, based on fabricated and misrepresented data, and using intentionally misleading and dishonest methodology to present falsehood as truth.5 For a detailed dissection of Rudolph's writing, please see the above footnote, which makes for fascinating - if chilling - reading.\n\n------------------\n\n\n**On the motivation of Holocaust Deniers**\n\n\nHolocaust deniers are invariably motivated by ideological beliefs. In comparison to a historian, who forms theories based on evidence, Holocaust deniers cherry pick or fabricate evidence to support their ideological beliefs. These beliefs are, invariably, based on \"hatred of Jews or a desire to rehabilitate the discredited philosophy of National Socialism.\"6 In other words, Holocaust deniers invariably deny the Holocaust due to their deep-seated ideological beliefs, rather than any kind of evidence-based reasoning. /u/CrossyNZ, in a post three years ago on this topic, laid out (with some of the most brilliant prose I've ever seen) the motivation of deniers better than I could ever hope to:\n\n&gt;*\"The Holocaust is a site of rich meaning and understanding, understandings which have be made into a narrative about what is true virtue, and what happens in the lack of it. Although awful, other genocides did not get this build up of meaning around them, and so are pushed into the public's historical background. As historians we know how some events carry more \"charge\" and meaning around them. ((For Americans, examples would be things like Pearl Harbor, the dropping of the atomic bombs, and 9/11. Events which polarize people because they see that event as a day when the world for them \"altered\".))*\n\n&gt;*\"In some ways, therefore, and forgive me, Holocaust deniers aren't attacking the historical truth of the holocaust - that would be an absurd thing to do. If it was just the historical truth of the Holocaust free from this meaning, then they wouldn't give two figs. They are seeking to reject parts of that richness of understanding built up around it that they find themselves objecting to - and they chose this ridiculous, offensive method to do it. As an historian and a human being, I cannot have more contempt for them.*\n\n&gt;*\"Trying to convince them of the obvious, blatant truth of the Holocaust is therefore a lost cause, because they are not interested in the truth. They are interested in making go away whatever crawling feeling they get when the meanings attached to the holocaust - the dangers of racism, classifications, and intolerance - call out their own value set as dangerous and potentially destructive. A \"direct attack\" on their methods - pointing out the thousands of witnesses, showing the immense amount of physical evidence (both the grounds of the camps themselves and the vast amount of paperwork created by this event) - is a waste of time, because it doesn't address the real issue; that the person so denying doesn't want it to be true. Why don't they? Maybe they are convinced by racism, just a little, in their heart of hearts. Maybe they hate Israel and equate all Jews with it. The thing is, you can't know these other reasons. If you don't know what their problem is, you can't change their mind by arguing. Therefore, I suppose, the only thing to do with Holocaust deniers is to feel contempt for their methods, ignore their attempts to engage you in a public conversation, and pity them that they could have such a conflict inside them it causes them to forsake reality.\"*\n\nHolocaust denial is the victory of hatred and dogma over empathy, reason and truth in the minds of its proponents. It is a tragic phenomenon that we encounter all too often. I hope the above explanation will help you to understand it. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to respond.\n\n\n**Sources**\n\n\n&gt;Catriona Mckinnon, \"Should we tolerate Holocaust Denial?\" Res Publica 13.1 (2007), 9.

They would likely claim, for instance, that I am a paid shill. Since they aim to propagate lies in the face of insurmountable evidence, they must rely on fallacious verbal arguments, ideological dogma and the exploitation of ignorance to spread their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An excellent example of the above is the writing of Germar Rudolph, a German chemist and Holocaust denier. Rudolph authored a paper in 1991 titled &amp;quot;Report on the formation and verifiability of cyanide compounds in the Auschwitz gas chambers,&amp;quot; wherein he asserted various claims against the plausibility of the gas chamber system at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. To the untrained eye, Rudolph&amp;#39;s report appears academic, however upon examination it is false in its entirety, based on fabricated and misrepresented data, and using intentionally misleading and dishonest methodology to present falsehood as truth.5 For a detailed dissection of Rudolph&amp;#39;s writing, please see the above footnote, which makes for fascinating - if chilling - reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the motivation of Holocaust Deniers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holocaust deniers are invariably motivated by ideological beliefs. In comparison to a historian, who forms theories based on evidence, Holocaust deniers cherry pick or fabricate evidence to support their ideological beliefs. These beliefs are, invariably, based on &amp;quot;hatred of Jews or a desire to rehabilitate the discredited philosophy of National Socialism.&amp;quot;6 In other words, Holocaust deniers invariably deny the Holocaust due to their deep-seated ideological beliefs, rather than any kind of evidence-based reasoning. &lt;a href=\"/u/CrossyNZ\"&gt;/u/CrossyNZ&lt;/a&gt;, in a post three years ago on this topic, laid out (with some of the most brilliant prose I&amp;#39;ve ever seen) the motivation of deniers better than I could ever hope to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The Holocaust is a site of rich meaning and understanding, understandings which have be made into a narrative about what is true virtue, and what happens in the lack of it. Although awful, other genocides did not get this build up of meaning around them, and so are pushed into the public&amp;#39;s historical background. As historians we know how some events carry more &amp;quot;charge&amp;quot; and meaning around them. ((For Americans, examples would be things like Pearl Harbor, the dropping of the atomic bombs, and 9/11. Events which polarize people because they see that event as a day when the world for them &amp;quot;altered&amp;quot;.))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;In some ways, therefore, and forgive me, Holocaust deniers aren&amp;#39;t attacking the historical truth of the holocaust - that would be an absurd thing to do. If it was just the historical truth of the Holocaust free from this meaning, then they wouldn&amp;#39;t give two figs. They are seeking to reject parts of that richness of understanding built up around it that they find themselves objecting to - and they chose this ridiculous, offensive method to do it. As an historian and a human being, I cannot have more contempt for them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Trying to convince them of the obvious, blatant truth of the Holocaust is therefore a lost cause, because they are not interested in the truth. They are interested in making go away whatever crawling feeling they get when the meanings attached to the holocaust - the dangers of racism, classifications, and intolerance - call out their own value set as dangerous and potentially destructive. A &amp;quot;direct attack&amp;quot; on their methods - pointing out the thousands of witnesses, showing the immense amount of physical evidence (both the grounds of the camps themselves and the vast amount of paperwork created by this event) - is a waste of time, because it doesn&amp;#39;t address the real issue; that the person so denying doesn&amp;#39;t want it to be true. Why don&amp;#39;t they? Maybe they are convinced by racism, just a little, in their heart of hearts. Maybe they hate Israel and equate all Jews with it. The thing is, you can&amp;#39;t know these other reasons. If you don&amp;#39;t know what their problem is, you can&amp;#39;t change their mind by arguing. Therefore, I suppose, the only thing to do with Holocaust deniers is to feel contempt for their methods, ignore their attempts to engage you in a public conversation, and pity them that they could have such a conflict inside them it causes them to forsake reality.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holocaust denial is the victory of hatred and dogma over empathy, reason and truth in the minds of its proponents. It is a tragic phenomenon that we encounter all too often. I hope the above explanation will help you to understand it. If you have any questions, please don&amp;#39;t hesitate to respond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Catriona Mckinnon, &amp;quot;Should we tolerate Holocaust Denial?&amp;quot; Res Publica 13.1 (2007), 9.
