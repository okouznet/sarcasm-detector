I'm going to spoiler out some stuff just to be safe, but pretty much everything up to the last paragraph is stuff you've already seen, and even the last paragraph is a general thing about the show. \n\n&gt;Don't get me wrong, I love the whole series, it's easily my favorite anime out of everything I've watched. Episode 3 just kind of stood out as an even brighter star than the rest of the brilliant constellation.\n\n&gt;To me, episode 3 was my first real moment of realization that Schichika lacked humanity, and truly was a sword, not just some funny goof who was a very skilled fighter.\n\n&gt;Up until that point, the opponents had been tainted by the blades. The [Katanagatari ep1](/s \"Maniwa fought only for himself, and sought to eliminate Schichika and Togame right there. He had to die, both for self-preservation and to acquire the sword.\") Even the bandits encountered on the road are violent and, if not for the mountainous difference in skill, could have been justifiable fatalities for Schichika as an aloof warrior. [Katanagatari ep2](/s \"Ginkaku was a more tragic character, and while he is more respectable than the first opponent, he clings to tightly to the past and is, again, openly violent, assuring Togame that the only way she can get his sword is to kill him.\")\n\n&gt;[Katanagatari ep3](/s \"Meisai is a totally different story to those two. She isn't just fighting to protect herself. She is fighting to protect all of her maidens in the shrine. She is the first to not have been tainted by the deviant blade, and instead is using it to heal instead of wound or poison. She uses non-violent means as a first method in an attempt to shake the resolve of Schichika, instead of immediately trying to kill him. She only resorts to fighting after she discovers the truth about Shcichika's character: he is not a human, he is a sword. By the end of it, I was almost rooting for Meisai, at the very least I wanted her to live, but Schichika did not feel the same way. She was an obstacle to be cut down, regardless of morality.\")\n\n&gt;For me atleast, this episode set the precedent for the beautiful character development throughout the series by allowing us to look back and see how far Schichika had come. Seeing him grow more and more human each episode made him such a great character, [Katanagatari Climax](/s \"and made the impact all the more potent when he learns of the darker side of human emotion within the last few episodes.\") Again, I love the whole series, but this episode stands out in my mind, even among the amazing finale.\n", "parent_id": "t1_d88ajvv", "author_flair_css_class": "MAL", "id": "d88zur1", "ups": 8, "mod_reports": [], "stickied": false, "chain": [{"subreddit": "anime", "saved": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh22", "link_id": "t3_55530y", "author": "kslqdkql", "report_reasons": null, "removal_reason": null, "body": "Ralon17 and OverweightPlatypus were right, Meisai was definitely likable!

My understanding of your question - and hence what I'll answer is 'What exactly is Holocaust denial, and what aspects of the Holocaust do deniers reject?\" Additionally, I'll discuss how Holocaust deniers deny the Holocaust. I'll also touch on the motivations of deniers, which is inextricably linked with their methodology.\n\n----\n\n**What exactly is Holocaust denial?**\n\nHolocaust denial's best, simple definition is \"the activity of denying the occurrence of key events and processes which constitute the Holocaust.\"1 Since deniers have no unified set of beliefs, exactly which aspect/s of the Holocaust they deny can vary greatly. Almost invariably, their claims boil down to a conclusion stating that the established number of individuals killed by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust - either six or eleven million, depending on whether non-Jewish victims of German mass-murders are included in the total - is false, and that the 'true' number of victims is considerably lower than the above totals.\n\nA Holocaust denier might claim, for instance, that a total of one million Jews were killed (though they will usually also claim they merely 'died' rather than being deliberately murdered), as opposed to the established total of ~six million. Holocaust deniers will often also deny the methodology of the Holocaust. They will often claim that Nazi Germany's 'Final Solution' aimed only to deport Jews from the Reich (as opposed to their mass murder), and may deny any or all of the following: state-organised mass murder of Jews and other minorities; the death camp system; gas chambers in the death camps; and the existence or actions of the SS Einsatzgruppen. The exact nature of what is being denied often varies, but the theme remains clear: Holocaust deniers deny one or more aspects of the Holocaust, and purport that the number of Jews and other minorities murdered in the Holocaust is subsequently lower than the historically established figures.\n\n-----------\n\n**What is the methodology of Holocaust Deniers?**\n\nHolocaust deniers deny the Holocaust in the face of a truly extraordinary mountain of evidence. The factual accuracy of the Holocaust is completely irrefutable, and no rational, informed individual would ever dispute its existence or its methodology. Few, if any, events in history are as well recorded, studied, examined and re-examined as the Holocaust. While there remains, of course, a huge amount to be learned about the minutiae of the Holocaust, its scale and functionality are so thoroughly documented by untold millions of photographs, eyewitness accounts, contemporary documents, film reels and items of physical evidence (for instance, collections of the wedding rings and shoes of those 'processed' through the death camp system or the gas chambers themselves) that rational, evidence-based disputes of its general methodology and progression are non-existent.\n\nHolocaust deniers hence find themselves attempting to deny established fact. They have no significant evidence to support their denial, and hence resort to a variety of methods ranging from fabricated evidence and psuedo-academic argumentation to emotional claims of far-reaching conspiracy - inevitably masterminded by Jews. They will often attempt to dismiss the vast array of evidence demonstrating the existence of the Holocaust as forgeries and lies planted by the above-mentioned conspirators to fool the public, in order to avoid engaging with said evidence. They would likely claim, for instance, that I am a paid shill. Since they aim to propagate lies in the face of insurmountable evidence, they must rely on fallacious verbal arguments, ideological dogma and the exploitation of ignorance to spread their beliefs.\n\nAn excellent example of the above is the writing of Germar Rudolph, a German chemist and Holocaust denier. Rudolph authored a paper in 1991 titled \"Report on the formation and verifiability of cyanide compounds in the Auschwitz gas chambers,\" wherein he asserted various claims against the plausibility of the gas chamber system at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. To the untrained eye, Rudolph's report appears academic, however upon examination it is false in its entirety, based on fabricated and misrepresented data, and using intentionally misleading and dishonest methodology to present falsehood as truth.5 For a detailed dissection of Rudolph's writing, please see the above footnote, which makes for fascinating - if chilling - reading.\n\n------------------\n\n\n**On the motivation of Holocaust Deniers**\n\n\nHolocaust deniers are invariably motivated by ideological beliefs. In comparison to a historian, who forms theories based on evidence, Holocaust deniers cherry pick or fabricate evidence to support their ideological beliefs. These beliefs are, invariably, based on \"hatred of Jews or a desire to rehabilitate the discredited philosophy of National Socialism.\"6 In other words, Holocaust deniers invariably deny the Holocaust due to their deep-seated ideological beliefs, rather than any kind of evidence-based reasoning. /u/CrossyNZ, in a post three years ago on this topic, laid out (with some of the most brilliant prose I've ever seen) the motivation of deniers better than I could ever hope to:\n\n&gt;*\"The Holocaust is a site of rich meaning and understanding, understandings which have be made into a narrative about what is true virtue, and what happens in the lack of it. Although awful, other genocides did not get this build up of meaning around them, and so are pushed into the public's historical background. As historians we know how some events carry more \"charge\" and meaning around them. ((For Americans, examples would be things like Pearl Harbor, the dropping of the atomic bombs, and 9/11. Events which polarize people because they see that event as a day when the world for them \"altered\".))*\n\n&gt;*\"In some ways, therefore, and forgive me, Holocaust deniers aren't attacking the historical truth of the holocaust - that would be an absurd thing to do. If it was just the historical truth of the Holocaust free from this meaning, then they wouldn't give two figs. They are seeking to reject parts of that richness of understanding built up around it that they find themselves objecting to - and they chose this ridiculous, offensive method to do it. As an historian and a human being, I cannot have more contempt for them.*\n\n&gt;*\"Trying to convince them of the obvious, blatant truth of the Holocaust is therefore a lost cause, because they are not interested in the truth. They are interested in making go away whatever crawling feeling they get when the meanings attached to the holocaust - the dangers of racism, classifications, and intolerance - call out their own value set as dangerous and potentially destructive. A \"direct attack\" on their methods - pointing out the thousands of witnesses, showing the immense amount of physical evidence (both the grounds of the camps themselves and the vast amount of paperwork created by this event) - is a waste of time, because it doesn't address the real issue; that the person so denying doesn't want it to be true. Why don't they? Maybe they are convinced by racism, just a little, in their heart of hearts. Maybe they hate Israel and equate all Jews with it. The thing is, you can't know these other reasons. If you don't know what their problem is, you can't change their mind by arguing. Therefore, I suppose, the only thing to do with Holocaust deniers is to feel contempt for their methods, ignore their attempts to engage you in a public conversation, and pity them that they could have such a conflict inside them it causes them to forsake reality.\"*\n\nHolocaust denial is the victory of hatred and dogma over empathy, reason and truth in the minds of its proponents. It is a tragic phenomenon that we encounter all too often. I hope the above explanation will help you to understand it. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to respond.\n\n\n**Sources**\n\n\n&gt;Catriona Mckinnon, \"Should we tolerate Holocaust Denial?\" Res Publica 13.1 (2007), 9.

Rudolph authored a paper in 1991 titled &amp;quot;Report on the formation and verifiability of cyanide compounds in the Auschwitz gas chambers,&amp;quot; wherein he asserted various claims against the plausibility of the gas chamber system at the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. To the untrained eye, Rudolph&amp;#39;s report appears academic, however upon examination it is false in its entirety, based on fabricated and misrepresented data, and using intentionally misleading and dishonest methodology to present falsehood as truth.5 For a detailed dissection of Rudolph&amp;#39;s writing, please see the above footnote, which makes for fascinating - if chilling - reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the motivation of Holocaust Deniers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holocaust deniers are invariably motivated by ideological beliefs. In comparison to a historian, who forms theories based on evidence, Holocaust deniers cherry pick or fabricate evidence to support their ideological beliefs. These beliefs are, invariably, based on &amp;quot;hatred of Jews or a desire to rehabilitate the discredited philosophy of National Socialism.&amp;quot;6 In other words, Holocaust deniers invariably deny the Holocaust due to their deep-seated ideological beliefs, rather than any kind of evidence-based reasoning. &lt;a href=\"/u/CrossyNZ\"&gt;/u/CrossyNZ&lt;/a&gt;, in a post three years ago on this topic, laid out (with some of the most brilliant prose I&amp;#39;ve ever seen) the motivation of deniers better than I could ever hope to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;The Holocaust is a site of rich meaning and understanding, understandings which have be made into a narrative about what is true virtue, and what happens in the lack of it. Although awful, other genocides did not get this build up of meaning around them, and so are pushed into the public&amp;#39;s historical background. As historians we know how some events carry more &amp;quot;charge&amp;quot; and meaning around them. ((For Americans, examples would be things like Pearl Harbor, the dropping of the atomic bombs, and 9/11. Events which polarize people because they see that event as a day when the world for them &amp;quot;altered&amp;quot;.))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;In some ways, therefore, and forgive me, Holocaust deniers aren&amp;#39;t attacking the historical truth of the holocaust - that would be an absurd thing to do. If it was just the historical truth of the Holocaust free from this meaning, then they wouldn&amp;#39;t give two figs. They are seeking to reject parts of that richness of understanding built up around it that they find themselves objecting to - and they chose this ridiculous, offensive method to do it. As an historian and a human being, I cannot have more contempt for them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Trying to convince them of the obvious, blatant truth of the Holocaust is therefore a lost cause, because they are not interested in the truth. They are interested in making go away whatever crawling feeling they get when the meanings attached to the holocaust - the dangers of racism, classifications, and intolerance - call out their own value set as dangerous and potentially destructive. A &amp;quot;direct attack&amp;quot; on their methods - pointing out the thousands of witnesses, showing the immense amount of physical evidence (both the grounds of the camps themselves and the vast amount of paperwork created by this event) - is a waste of time, because it doesn&amp;#39;t address the real issue; that the person so denying doesn&amp;#39;t want it to be true. Why don&amp;#39;t they? Maybe they are convinced by racism, just a little, in their heart of hearts. Maybe they hate Israel and equate all Jews with it. The thing is, you can&amp;#39;t know these other reasons. If you don&amp;#39;t know what their problem is, you can&amp;#39;t change their mind by arguing. Therefore, I suppose, the only thing to do with Holocaust deniers is to feel contempt for their methods, ignore their attempts to engage you in a public conversation, and pity them that they could have such a conflict inside them it causes them to forsake reality.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holocaust denial is the victory of hatred and dogma over empathy, reason and truth in the minds of its proponents. It is a tragic phenomenon that we encounter all too often. I hope the above explanation will help you to understand it. If you have any questions, please don&amp;#39;t hesitate to respond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Catriona Mckinnon, &amp;quot;Should we tolerate Holocaust Denial?&amp;quot; Res Publica 13.1 (2007), 9.

And the Franco-Canadians that do exist here have co-existed for so long that they're basically indistinguishable from the rest of the Anglo-Canadian population. The way \"English and French are Canada's official languages, use it, non-assimilating non-white people!\" meme on this sub annoys me to no end because there is no actual support for French content or topics on this sub. It's really almost always utilized exclusively by Anglo-white supremacists under the guise of some mild mannered Canadian nationalism. The one time I recall someone posting on this sub asking if there were any Francophones around it was downvoted to hell and the comments were \"je veu du fromage\" type stuff. Please, stop using French as some weird tool to push your agenda against \"foreign\" languages when aside from that, you never cared about French issues to begin with. The reason why French signage exists in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick isn't because of some abstract Canadian nationalist sentiment, it's because there is a population that would do better because of it. The equivalents here in BC are Chinese and Punjabi because those are the most used languages after English. They are living breathing languages being used on a daily basis. If it weren't for the perceived threat of new cultures and peoples co-existing in the same space as previously Anglo-dominated regions, nobody in BC would even give two hoots about French, and that was just the way it was before all this Richmond Chinese Sign Ghetto nonsense was spread around on the internet. \n\nRedditors on r/Vancouver are also dancing around the bear in the room - that even from a historical standpoint the Chinese and Pacific Asian countries have had a far greater influence here in both a human, political, and economic capacity that was only curtailed by artificial limitations placed on them like the Chinese Head Tax or outright exclusion. The only reason French is even taught in K-12 here is because the government forces it. From a practical perspective, teaching any of the Asian languages would both be much more useful given Asia's proximity to the west coast and easier to learn given that their are large populations of native speakers for most of the major languages. Think about it... Vancouver is in a unique situation that almost no other city is in to take advantage of a a region where there are tonnes of 0th generation Chinese, Indians, and Koreans who all speak their native languages. \n\nThese are major world languages with potentially millions of future customers and emerging markets. So why the fuck not take advantage of it? Why shouldn't ever goddamn person in this goddamn region be trilingual? Vancouver has the criteria to become a truly global mega-city in the future which dwarfs Seattle, but people are too fucked in the head to realize it because they're too proud to give up their version of \"Canadian\" culture. We could have been the Singapore of the West Coast, or even better, but nope, fuck learning an actual second or third language. Fuck immigrants, am I right? How about, instead of trying to eliminate foreign influences to save a non-existent quasi Anglo-French identity, maybe British Columbians should realize it never existed here in the first place. Let's be honest, people in BC can't understand any French to save our lives. I went through French education for 12 years and I can't even remember a thing of what I was taught, because there is truly nobody to talk in French with. But there is a LARGE Chinese population just south of Vancouver you know, so why not like, take advantage of it? Why does every single fucking thing have to be a negative? How about the next time you see a Chinese language sign, be like, oh shit I know what that means, maybe I should translate it, go into the store, and ask if maybe the owner would like you to know what it means in English? Maybe the next time you see a Chinese only menu, you could offer to translate it and show them that there are actually non-Chinese people who'll use their services, so they'll be incentivized to include English as well?

And the Franco-Canadians that do exist here have co-existed for so long that they&amp;#39;re basically indistinguishable from the rest of the Anglo-Canadian population. The way &amp;quot;English and French are Canada&amp;#39;s official languages, use it, non-assimilating non-white people!&amp;quot; meme on this sub annoys me to no end because there is no actual support for French content or topics on this sub. It&amp;#39;s really almost always utilized exclusively by Anglo-white supremacists under the guise of some mild mannered Canadian nationalism. The one time I recall someone posting on this sub asking if there were any Francophones around it was downvoted to hell and the comments were &amp;quot;je veu du fromage&amp;quot; type stuff. Please, stop using French as some weird tool to push your agenda against &amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot; languages when aside from that, you never cared about French issues to begin with. The reason why French signage exists in Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick isn&amp;#39;t because of some abstract Canadian nationalist sentiment, it&amp;#39;s because there is a population that would do better because of it. The equivalents here in BC are Chinese and Punjabi because those are the most used languages after English. They are living breathing languages being used on a daily basis. If it weren&amp;#39;t for the perceived threat of new cultures and peoples co-existing in the same space as previously Anglo-dominated regions, nobody in BC would even give two hoots about French, and that was just the way it was before all this Richmond Chinese Sign Ghetto nonsense was spread around on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Redditors on &lt;a href=\"/r/Vancouver\"&gt;r/Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; are also dancing around the bear in the room - that even from a historical standpoint the Chinese and Pacific Asian countries have had a far greater influence here in both a human, political, and economic capacity that was only curtailed by artificial limitations placed on them like the Chinese Head Tax or outright exclusion. The only reason French is even taught in K-12 here is because the government forces it.
